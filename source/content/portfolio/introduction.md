Grant funding is a critical element of GPOBA’s mission, serving as the catalyst for design and implementation of OBA projects. GPOBA grants provide operational support for subsidy projects, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge dissemination. Monitoring and evaluating project performance is a key part of the team’s work, with project completion reports, evaluations, and assessments all informing the design of future pilot projects and contributing to GPOBA’s development as a Center of Expertise on the use of OBA/RBF.

FY15 was a strong year for GPOBA, with five new grant agreements signed for subsidy projects, eight TA activities initiated in support of OBA/RBF projects, and ten new knowledge dissemination activities. There was a focus on scaling up successful OBA projects and mainstreaming OBA approaches in cooperation with governments and other development partners.

GPOBA initiated a new team structure during the year, with project leads now responsible for supporting activities from concept stage through grant closure, rather than handing off projects upon implementation to the former Portfolio Team. This change increases accountability, knowledge flow, and consistency, allowing clients to maintain the same point of contact for the life of a project. 

Below are some highlights of GPOBA’s year: 

- As of June 2015, the GPOBA cumulative subsidy portfolio consists of **44 grant agreements in seven sectors, totaling $228 million**. Three projects closed in FY15, bringing to 28 the number of closed projects in GPOBA’s subsidy portfolio from which valuable lessons are being drawn. 
- **GPOBA disbursed a total of $10 million in FY15 for subsidy projects**, bringing cumulative disbursements since 2006 to $116.3 million. 
- **Five new grant agreements were signed** for a total of $50 million, including three scale-ups of successful GPOBA pilots in Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda.
- **Eight new TA activities were initiated**, totaling $1.4 million.
- **Ten new knowledge dissemination activities** were undertaken for $1.7 million.

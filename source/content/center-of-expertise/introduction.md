As a Center of Expertise (CoE), GPOBA serves donors, development partners, and stakeholders by sharing best practices and lessons learned on OBA/RBF approaches. In FY16, GPOBA continued its work as a CoE – deepening its technical expertise and expanding the reach of its knowledge and dissemination activities. Central to GPOBA’s role as a CoE supporting the expansion of the OBA/RBF community and the increased use of OBA/RBF is the development of partnerships both within and external to the World Bank. Some highlights of this year’s collaborative activities are detailed below.

GPOBA also has a significant cumulative portfolio of TA and knowledge activities, with 177 projects totaling $28 million. TA support for RBF activities is wide ranging and includes work with the World Bank’s Program for Results (PforR), which links disbursement of funds to governments to the achievement of specific program results. GPOBA has provided TA for five PforR operations: Ethiopia (urban), Tanzania (education), Brazil (multi-sectoral), Mexico (water and sanitation) and Uruguay (transport), the latter four projects were active in FY15. GPOBA’s RBF activities have indirectly benefitted approximately 3 million people. Both TA and knowledge activities are reported in more detail throughout this report.

[^2]: The International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. Countries that lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and those with per capita gross national income below $1,175 are eligible for IDA support. Countries that are IDA-eligible based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some IBRD borrowings are referred to as ‘blend’ countries.

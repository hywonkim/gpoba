Publications, learning programs, technical assistance, advisory initiatives, and convening activities are all part of GPOBA’s work. This fiscal year, GPOBA led a four-day Learning and Knowledge Exchange trip to Bangladesh with DFID and Sida (see Box 4), and facilitated South-South Knowledge Exchanges both virtually and in Uganda, with client countries and project teams sharing lessons learned from the implementation of renewable and grid energy projects (see Box 5). GPOBA also participated in Sida’s Results Based Financing Approaches (RBFA) workshop and developed and delivered the OBA/RBF Knowledge and Project Clinic with the African Development Bank, and was a strong participant in both World Water Week, with a session featuring client participation from Ghana as well as the Gates Foundation, and the World Bank’s Water Week.

Technical Assistance (TA) continues to be a critical component of GPOBA’s work, testing the applicability of OBA/RBF in new sectors and environments, laying the foundation for project design, building capacity among partners and governments, and supporting the mainstreaming of OBA approaches. The insights and experience gained from TA initiatives feed back into GPOBA’s knowledge on OBA/RBF approaches and are shared with other practitioners.

In FY15, GPOBA disbursed $4.8 million for TA activities, discussed here, and knowledge sharing and dissemination (presented under the Center of Expertise section). Support was provided for 16 active TA initiatives in the water, sanitation, energy, education, health, transport and telecom sectors, as well as for capacity building for independent verification. During the fiscal year, eight new TA activities in support of OBA/RBF projects were initiated, totaling $1.4 million and supporting work in the education, solid waste, water, and energy sectors. One activity is multi-sectoral, and supports the development of a beneficiary feedback system in Brazil for results-based aid and management, as part of a World Bank PforR project.

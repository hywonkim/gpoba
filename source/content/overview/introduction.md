Increasing access to basic infrastructure and social services is critical to reducing poverty. Too often in developing countries, however, the gap between what it costs to deliver a service and what potential users are able to pay means that millions go without access to clean water, electricity, healthcare, and other basic services. Traditional aid, which makes disbursements against expenditures or contracts, commonly lacks mechanisms for measuring results and monitoring financial accountability, and there is increasing recognition among donors and governments that alternative approaches to service delivery and poverty reduction are needed. 

Output-based aid (OBA) is one such alternative whose use is increasing. A form of Results-based financing (RBF), OBA is an innovative mechanism that links disbursements to the delivery of specific, agreed upon ‘outputs’. In an OBA project, service delivery is contracted out to a third party – a government or private sector entity – who pre-finances the project and receives a subsidy to complement or replace user fees. Because the subsidy is tied to results or performance, it is paid out only after outputs have been delivered and independently verified. Outputs can include such things as connections of poor households to electricity grids or water supply systems, or the delivery of basic healthcare services. Subsidies can be once-off, transitional, or ongoing, depending on the sector, project, and circumstances. Because they support the mobilization of private capital, OBA subsidies encourage service providers to expand services to poor households where otherwise no clear market incentive exists. 

GPOBA has supported innovative OBA pilots in seven sectors in XX countries, and has recently expanded its work to include other RBF mechanisms. In FY15, GPOBA passed the milestone of eight million direct beneficiaries reached. Through a diverse portfolio of 44 projects with $228 million in subsidy funding and a range of technical assistance activities, GPOBA is demonstrating that OBA/RBF approaches are effective alternatives to traditional aid, delivering lasting results in a transparent and accountable manner, whether through solar home systems in Bangladesh, education in Vietnam, or reproductive health in Uganda.

The fiscal year brought collaboration and partnership opportunities for GPOBA under the umbrella of the World Bank’s Global Practice for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience (GSURR) in the Partnerships and Resource Mobilization unit. This specialized unit includes GPOBA, the Tokyo Development Learning Center, and other key partners involved in the work of creating sustainable communities. GPOBA also continued to strengthen its existing relationships with key Global Practices within the World Bank, focusing on such thematic issues as increased leveraging of private investment in access to services for the poor, public-private partnerships (PPPs), and gender mainstreaming. 

* **International Finance Corporation (IFC).** GPOBA and IFC have already worked together within a number of PPPs. In FY16, GPOBA partnered more closely with IFC in its Advisory and PPP groups. GPOBA and IFC are developing a joint training and project models focused on deepening the understanding of how OBA/RBF can increase the impact and reach of PPPs for core infrastructure and basic services in poor and marginalized communities. This collaboration will focus on practical application and demonstration, preparing case studies of past GPOBA/IFC collaborative projects, such as West Bank Solid Waste Management and Liberia Energy, as well as those under preparation, such as the Burkina Faso irrigation project. 

* **Water Global Practice and Water and Sanitation Program (WSP).** GPOBA works closely with the World Bank’s Water Practice, and maintained a strong presence at its Water Week 2016, with OBA featuring prominently in a number of discussions. It was cited as a tool within PPPs to ensure that the poor are included in private-sector service provision, while in the context of rapid urbanization, OBA was highlighted as one financing instrument with the potential to move beyond sector-specific approaches to address the multi-sectoral problems facing low-income households. OBA was also recognized as an instrument that can help leverage much-needed private sector commercial finance for investment in water supply and sanitation. Finally, it was a key part of a financial analysis training being conducted for task team leaders, and featured in a knowledge note on blended financing (http://www.gpoba.org/Kenya.WS.Scaleup) prepared for the 2016 International Monetary Fund and World Bank Spring Meetings. 

* **Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP).** GPOBA continued its long-standing collaboration with ESMAP, this year primarily through a focus on gender, sharing lessons learned on mainstreaming gender in energy access from OBA project design, implementation, and impact assessments. GPOBA participated in the panel ‘Gender-Informed Subsidy Reforms’ and in the Electric Cooperatives workshop on mainstreaming gender in energy distribution services; the team also provided inputs to Global Status of Energy Access on the role of RBF in increasing energy access for the poor, using examples from GPOBA’s energy portfolio.

* **Tokyo Development Learning Center (TDLC).** TDLC is a state-of-the art knowledge and learning center that supports the documentation and sharing of development experiences, lessons, and solutions with practitioners and institutions in World Bank client countries. TDLC’s signature activity is the operationally focused ‘technical deep dive’, which brings together governments, team leaders, and other stakeholders to focus on demand-driven topics (e.g., disaster risk management, urban planning, and urban service provisions) and results in practical client-owned action plans. In FY16, GPOBA provided technical expertise to TDLC within a number of areas identified for collaboration, including project preparation, evidence-based approaches and indicators, best practices in knowledge capture, and OBA/RBF as a tool for social inclusion.

GPOBA continues to develop as a **Center of Expertise**. The aim is ensure that knowledge and experience gained through the design and implementation of OBA subsidy projects and TA activities feeds back into GPOBAâ€™s own operations and is shared with donors, governments, and other development partners to support the use of OBA/RBF and to demonstrate proof of concept.

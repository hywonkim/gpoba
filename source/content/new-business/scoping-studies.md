A key part of GPOBA’s commitment to testing the applicability of OBA/RBF in new sectors, operating environments is the use of scoping studies. These studies help to determine how and where OBA/RBF interventions might be most effective, and whether they align strategically with GPOBA’s objectives and capacities.  

**Education**: The scoping study in education was completed in FY15. It looked at the use of RBF overall, and OBA in particular, in the education sector in developing countries to determine to what extent and how best OBA approaches can increase access to quality education for low-income populations. Based on the literature review and analysis of 24 projects applying OBA, the team made specific recommendations for GPOBA involvement in the sector. A component of the study was a beneficiary assessment of GPOBA’s Vietnam Education Enhancement project, which disbursed subsidies on achievement of pre-approved indicators related to student attendance and educational attainment. 

**Urban transport:** GPOBA has previously provided TA in the transport sector in Bogotá, supporting the development of pro-poor subsidy schemes for public transit. This year, a global study on OBA in urban transport was launched, with the aim of analyzing how OBA can be applied to address the challenges facing low-income people in developing countries in accessing urban transport services. In parallel with this study, GPOBA is exploring the possibility of an urban transport project in Bhutan, which would be the first GPOBA subsidy project in this sector. Ok to mention this Bhutan possibility?

**Climate Change:** A concept was developed for an initiative designed to explore the applicability of OBA/RBF for climate change mitigation and adaptation, including resilience and recovery from extreme climate phenomena. This activity constitutes a key part of the GPOBA Programmatic Initiative on Climate Change. The objective is to inform the dialogue on the implementation of OBA/RBF mechanisms in the emerging climate change agenda, through holistic knowledge and operational approaches.

**Irrigation**: In FY2014, GPOBA finalized the first study exploring the use of  OBA as a financing mechanism for small-scale irrigation schemes in developing countries. The study analyzed schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, paying particular attention to opportunities in Bangladesh, Ghana, Kenya, India, and Zambia. The report recommended implementing OBA in irrigation through the private sector. As a result, GPOBA began collaborating with IFC to seek opportunities for a joint operation that could benefit from IFC knowledge of the sector and market/finance access, and OBA subsidies. An operation for smallholder cotton farmers in Burkina Faso is being analyzed at pre-concept stage.

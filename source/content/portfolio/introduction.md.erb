### FY16 Results Achieved
GPOBA maintained a robust and healthy portfolio during FY16, providing strong operational support throughout the year to its existing projects, including those being implemented in challenging and fragile environments, and signing two new grant agreements for investments in subsidy projects in the Philippines and Kenya, both in the energy sector. As OBA projects are results-based, disbursements against verified outputs are key performance indicators for demonstrating impact, and in FY16, GPOBA achieved the third highest level of subsidy disbursement since it began implementing projects in 2006. In addition, technical assistance and knowledge dissemination activities were strengthened throughout the year. These three strands of GPOBA’s portfolio together inform the design of future pilot projects and underpin GPOBA’s work as a Center of Expertise on the use of OBA/RBF. 

Here are some of the year’s highlights from GPOBA’s operations:

* As of June 2016, GPOBA’s cumulative subsidy portfolio consists of 46 grant agreements in seven sectors, totaling $234 million. One project, Public Health in the Philippines, closed in FY16, bringing to 30 the number of closed subsidy projects.
* GPOBA disbursed a total of $16.7 million in FY16 for subsidy projects, bringing cumulative disbursements since 2006 to $133 million and representing 9 million people reached by OBA projects for basic services.
* Two new grant agreements totaling $6 million were signed in the energy sector.
Details of GPOBA’s complete subsidy portfolio and disbursements to date can be found in the Appendices section.

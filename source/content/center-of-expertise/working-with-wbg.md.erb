From its location in the Global Practice for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience (GPSURR), GPOBA has continued to support urban and rural projects in which OBA and RBF offer viable solutions to access challenges, often as part of larger sector programs. Cross-practice collaboration is strongly emphasized under the new World Bank structure, and GPOBA is exemplifying this approach, supporting nearly half of the Bank’s new global practices, and working particularly closely with the energy and water practices. [quote]GPOBA provides support for both operations and knowledge activities, as it works to integrate OBA and RBF into infrastructure and development projects.[/quote]

**Support to GPSURR**: GPOBA delivered a number of knowledge-building presentations to GPSURR. These included a briefing presentation to GPSURR management and a briefing book for the Senior Director, as well as a presentation on OBA and service-provider behavior change during a town hall meeting. GPOBA took part in GPSURR collaborative platforms and developed a protocol on information flow from GPOBA to the GPSURR portal. GPOBA participated very actively in the organization of the GPSURR 2015 Forum, with the theme Building Sustainable Communities, delivering two OBA/RBF awareness sessions in Istanbul and Washington.

**Contributions to the World Bank’s Program for Results (PforR)**: Since the PforR program began three years ago, GPOBA has supported ten PforR projects with funding, conducted joint reviews, project design meetings and GPOBA trainings that include PforR project leaders. This fiscal year, GPOBA supported three ongoing PforR operations. Activities included development of disbursement- linked indicators in the water and sanitation sector in Mexico; support to the Ministry of Transport and Public Works in Uruguay on a road rehabilitation and maintenance program; and work in the education sector in Tanzania. A new TA initiative in FY15 supports a multi-sector PforR project to develop a beneficiary feedback system in Ceará, Brazil for results-based aid and management.

**Supporting RBF activities**: GPOBA provided technical assistance to two ongoing World Bank RBF initiatives during the fiscal year – one in Indonesia, building capacity for verification of outputs by central and local governments<!--(see Box 4)-->, and another in Zimbabwe, supporting the roll-out of RBF health vouchers. Two new TA activities for RBF were initiated in FY15: support to the World Bank Group Urban Team on an assessment of the solid waste sector in African cities and the development of an RBF mechanism and policy recommendations to improve services for the poor in these cities, and an initiative supporting the WEvolve program in South Asia, exploring opportunities for OBA/RBF to improve basic working conditions in the garment industry, an untested sector for GPOBA.

**Working with IFC**: Building on the 2014 irrigation scoping study recommendations to implement OBA in irrigation through the private sector, GPOBA worked with IFC to explore potential for a joint project in the irrigation sector. IFC had previously conducted a study on irrigation for smallholders in Burkina Faso, Zambia and India, and IFC and GPOBA teams scoped possibilities for a project that could benefit from both an OBA subsidy and IFC advisory services. GPOBA also worked to identify a pipeline of PPP projects in which OBA could be applied.

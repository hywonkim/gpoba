GPOBA derives its resources from donor contributions, which are channeled through trust funds administered by the World Bank Group. The World Bank recovers an administrative fee for costs associated with this task. GPOBA’s budget and accounting processes are aligned with the World Bank fiscal year, which runs from July to June.

### Contributions Received
As of June 30, 2015, GPOBA’s donors have pledged a total of $337.9 million to the program, of which $335.7 million has been received (Table A.1). In fiscal year 2015, GPOBA received $17.2 million from donors, including new contributions of $10.5 million from Sida (Table A.2).

Of the total disbursements this fiscal year, $15.8 million (93 percent) was related to the annual work program. Most of this amount ($9.6 million) was disbursement of subsidy funding for pilot projects under implementation, with the rest going to technical assistance, and preparation and supervision of projects. At $1.2 million, program management and administration represented 7 percent of total disbursements.


### Single Audit Process
The World Bank Group has instituted an annual ‘single audit’ exercise for all trust funds. As part of this exercise, the GPOBA program manager signs a trust fund representation letter attesting to the correctness and completeness of the financial process for all GPOBA trust funds. The task manager for each approved activity is required to confirm that due diligence has been exercised with respect to the administration, management, and monitoring of the funds awarded for the activity, and has ensured that all expenses and disbursements are made in accordance with World Bank procurement and administrative guidelines.

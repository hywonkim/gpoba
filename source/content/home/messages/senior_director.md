I am pleased to present the Annual Report for the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) for the fiscal year 2015 (FY15). GPOBA is marking the close of its first full year associated with the World Bank Group's Global Practice for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience (SURR). Our goal at this Global Practice is to build sustainable, inclusive, and resilient communities in support of the Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity. GPOBA is committed to using results-based approaches to provide access to basic services for the poor – a necessary foundation for economic and human development within communities.  

Leveraging partnerships for greater development impact is key to the work of the World Bank Group. GPOBA is an excellent example of linking relationships, resources, and results to deliver increased services for the poor.  This partnership also demonstrates how to work effectively across the World Bank Group, as GPOBA projects constitute nearly half of the Bank’s 14 global practices and selected units of the International Finance Corporation (IFC). Through building partnerships within the World Bank Group, as well as with governments, the private sector, and communities, GPOBA has now provided access to basic services for more than eight million people around the world. 

Since 2006, GPOBA has been implementing projects focused on reaching marginalized populations, with 82 percent of its work currently taking place in the world’s poorest countries. As we move into 2016, the recently approved Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be an important platform for GPOBA’s work. The SDGs focus on partnerships and the interconnection of social, economic, and environmental issues, and several include indicators linked to accessing basic services in sectors covered by GPOBA. 

Due to climate change, the challenges and disasters facing societies around the world will become more frequent and extreme in the coming years. A critical part of our Global Practice is strengthening resilience and preparedness among our clients, who are among the most vulnerable for the natural disasters of today, and those of tomorrow expected to be stronger and more frequent due to climate change. GPOBA will play a key role in this work, supporting governments and development partners in expanding services to the poor enhancing their resilience to disasters and climate change. 

The challenges and disasters facing societies around the world will become more frequent and extreme in the coming years. A critical part of SURR’s mission is strengthening resilience and preparedness among our clients, who are among the most vulnerable when shocks occur. GPOBA plays a key role in this work, supporting governments and development partners in expanding services to the poor. 

The creation of SURR’s Partnership and Resource Mobilization Unit in FY15 is recognition of the importance of partnerships to achieving our goals.  Carmen Nonay, formerly manager of GPOBA, leads this unit as practice manager, with GPOBA coming under her strategic management as one of our largest partnership programs.

We expect to leverage even further the work across partnership programs, and deepen our strategic engagement with development partners in the public, private and philanthropic sectors.

Knowledge management and learning remain as a cornerstone of GPOBA’s role as a CoE and its work in growing the OBA/RBF community. In FY16, GPOBA strengthened and expanded it knowledge repositories on new and existing platforms, and increased its participation in knowledge forums. A significantly enhanced technical learning program and strong library of publications rounded out GPOBA’s KMLI work. Box 5 gives details of GPOBA’s expanded learning and knowledge strategy.

**Community of Practice.** GPOBA develops, monitors, and refines collaborative tools for knowledge exchanges with OBA/RBF practitioners, donors, and external stakeholders, and GPOBA’s Community of Practice (CoP) is an essential part of this work, adding value to GPOBA as an online convener and knowledge broker. The CoP resides on the World Bank’s online platform, Collaboration for Development (http://www.gpoba.org/obacop) (C4D), where it is accessible to both World Bank staff and external partners. The CoP’s accessibility allows it to capitalize on the significant knowledge and experience that exists inside and outside the Bank, facilitating collaboration and knowledge flow beyond formal organizational structures and sharing best practices through cross-sectoral collaboration and networking. During the fiscal year, CoP membership nearly doubled mainly due to a targeted outreach to relevant OBA/RBF practitioners.

In FY16, the CoP won a GSURR award for its presentation and website, and became one of GSURR’s new Knowledge Silo Breakers, informal structures that connect across the World Bank Group and beyond on topics of special interest. The CoP was active in numerous face-to-face and online activities, including the Kenya Energy Conference and World Water Week 2015 (https://www.gpoba.org/worldwaterweek2015), where GPOBA convened a panel with representatives from the Gates Foundation and the Government of Ghana to discuss how OBA/RBF approaches can serve as efficient and practical tools for expanding water services to poor communities. The CoP also delivered webinars, hosted by subject-matter experts and facilitating peer-to-peer exchange among OBA/RBF practitioners and partners, including webinars in the water (http://www.gpoba.org/webinar_vietnamwater) and education (http://www.gpoba.org/webinar_education) sectors, and a webinar on Social Impact Bonds (http://www.gpoba.org/webinar_sibs). CoP members shared blog posts with the community on such topics as independent verification in Indonesia, energy for the rural poor in Ethiopia, and sanitation in Bangladesh. 

A major convening event in FY16 was the seminar, ‘Getting the Results They Pay For: Politics, Government Systems and Local Initiative’. Jointly organized by GPOBA, the Governance Global Practice, and the Human Development Group, the event explored how to coordinate different RBF approaches and reap synergies within the World Bank and with donors. The advantages of results-based approaches were presented by a Senior Fellow at the Center for Global Development, and included accountability and the opportunity for recipients to engage in local problem-solving. Discussants included Senior Specialists in Health, Social Protection, and Finance. Another convening event was the panel GPOBA hosted, ‘Mobility of the Urban Poor: Results-based Financing Schemes and Effective Subsidies’, which included a specialist consultant for infrastructure, public services and the urban environment, and the Transport and ICT Global Practice, and looked at issues of access to urban transport for low-income people developing economies. GPOBA also held a workshop in Brazil with government and stakeholders in the water, health and education sectors in support of the development of a beneficiary feedback system to inform results-based management processes in the state of Ceará. 

**Publications.** GPOBA continued to produce its two ongoing series, OBApproaches and Lessons Learned, which focused in FY16 on macro, thematic, and sectoral lessons gleaned from the application of OBA in addressing development challenges. OBApproaches focused on: the use of independent verification agents (IVAs) (http://www.gpoba.org/oba_iva) ; Public Private Partnerships and OBA (http://www.gpoba.org/oba_ppp); OBA and Energy Access (https://www.gpoba.org/oba_energy) and the use of OBA in Education (http://www.gpoba.org/oba_education). The Lessons Learned notes covered the OBA Education project in Vietnam (https://www.gpoba.org/lessons_vietnamwater) and the Ghana Solar PV Systems project  (http://www.gpoba.org/lessons_GhanaSHS). GPOBA also produced a user-friendly service provider guide, ‘Results-Based Financing for Water Service Providers in Kenya’(http://www.gpoba.org/rbf.water.kenya), and a widely shared technical publication, ‘Scaling up Blended Financing of Water and Sanitation Investments in Kenya’ (https://www.gpoba.org/Kenya.WS.Scaleup ) (see Box 3), which looked at interventions to improve access to commercial finance in the water and sanitation sector. GPOBA’s education scoping study (http://www.gpoba.org/edu.study-oba.analysis), completed at the end of FY15, was made available to the public through several face to face and virtual events, and the OBA/RBF glossary was developed. This glossary stores and organizes terms and critical concepts, linking with OBA publications and related documents in which OBA/RBF terminology is most often found. 

**Learning.** In parallel with the increasing interest in OBA/RBF and with GPOBA’s growth as a CoE, GPOBA expanded its learning program in FY16 to provide a greater range of resources, technical advice, and guidance on a demand-driven basis. Face-to-face convening events, as well as online opportunities – such as the new OBA/RBF Academy – offered GPOBA the opportunity to share its knowledge and experience with wider audiences. In support of its learning activities, GPOBA is linking with new strategies and technical platforms, models of success that represent the next generation of learning, knowledge sharing, and collaboration. 

**Innovation.** A solid learning program supports and sustains creative, inspired innovation. GPOBA encourages and recognizes such innovation, particularly through its annual Inn-OBA-tions Awards. In FY16, OBA/RBF interventions in climate and social inclusion, governance, energy, and solid waste management received awards. Highlights of this year’s accomplishments and developments in the areas of learning and innovation are found in Boxes 2, 4 and 5.

In FY15, GPOBA focused on moving the pipeline of existing projects forward, while also testing the applicability of OBA in new sectors, and scaling up successful OBA projects in sectors where it has considerable experience. Technical assistance continued to be an important part of GPOBA’s work, with eight new TA activities initiated in FY15. Two scoping studies were launched or completed on the use of OBA/RBF in new sectors –urban transport and education – and OBA approaches were tested and monitored throughout the year in fragile and conflict-affected situations. Together, these newly initiated and ongoing activities help to build GPOBA’s knowledge bank of best practices and lessons learned, reinforcing the crucial flow between project operations and knowledge.

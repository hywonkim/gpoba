GPOBA is a global partnership created in 2003 by the United Kingdom’s Department for International Development (DFID) and the World Bank, and administered by the World Bank. Originally designed to help prepare OBA projects and document and disseminate lessons learned, GPOBA began funding subsidy projects in 2006 through additional donor contributions. GPOBA also functions as a Center of Expertise on OBA/RBF approaches. Drawing on the knowledge and experience gained from project design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, GPOBA shares lessons and best practices with development partners and governments who are interested in the application of OBA and RBF. 

This report reviews GPOBA’s progress towards its objectives during the last fiscal year, July 1, 2015 through June 30, 2016.

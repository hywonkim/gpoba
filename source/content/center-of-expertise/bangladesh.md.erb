One of the highlights of GPOBA’s convening and learning work in FY16 was a four-day donor event held in Bangladesh that brought together representatives from Sida and DFID, the World Bank energy project team, implementing agencies, and local residents in OBA project areas. 

The event, which took place in Dhaka and Sylhet, included a comprehensive and hands on study of the World Bank Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Project (RERED). OBA clean energy projects have been part of RERED, including the highly successful solar home system (SHS) project, which installed 497,608 SHS. A GPOBA impact assessment following this project found that replacing smoke-emitting kerosene lamps with solar power was having several positive effects on daily life in rural Bangladesh, significantly reducing household air pollution, allowing schoolchildren to study in the evening, enhancing mobility and security (particularly for women and girls), and increasing connectivity to the outside world through increased use of radio, TV, and mobile devices. GPOBA’s scale-up project now underway in Bangladesh builds on the success of this pilot, expanding access to renewable energy to include mini-grids, solar irrigation pumps, and biogas plants, as well as SHSs. Field visits to view all of these renewable energy technologies allowed for discussions between donors, project teams, and local residents on the challenges, opportunities, and impacts of OBA projects. 

Donors shared their own programs and also learned about new OBA initiatives being developed in the sanitation and garment sectors in Bangladesh. The entire event was designed using the World Bank’s Art of Knowledge format, which maximized effective engagement, enabling GPOBA to better understand current donor priorities and expectations and identify potential new areas for collaboration.

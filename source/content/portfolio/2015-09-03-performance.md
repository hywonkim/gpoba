GPOBA reached a major milestone in FY15, providing eight million beneficiaries with access to basic infrastructure and services. Three projects were completed in FY15 – Solar PV Systems in Ghana, Bangladesh Solar Home Systems, and Extending Telecommunications in Rural Indonesia – raising to 28 the number of successfully completed projects. Disbursement for subsidy projects in FY15 was $10 million, bringing total cumulative disbursements to $116.3 million since the inception of the subsidy program in 2006. Details of the ways in which project performance is monitored and evaluated throughout the project cycle can be found in the Monitoring & Evaluation section of this report.

One of GPOBA’s priorities for the year was to provide operational support to teams working on subsidy projects, working closely with operations advisors, sector managers, and project clients to find solutions to challenges that arose during the project cycle. In FY15, many project impediments were the result of external factors, including earthquakes, civil unrest, and the Ebola outbreak. GPOBA focused operational support on seven projects that faced challenges to implementation. The projects were located in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Uganda, the West Bank, the Philippines, Kenya, and Liberia. Support included such activities as capacity building of verification agents and increasing outreach and awareness campaigns targeting beneficiaries.

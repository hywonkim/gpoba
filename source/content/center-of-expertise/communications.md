GPOBA’s ongoing communications strategy aims to position OBA in the context of RBF and the results agendas of development partners, as well as in the broader international discussion on aid effectiveness and innovative finance. In FY15, the communications team focused on activities to improve the program’s visibility and profile both within the World Bank Group and externally, and built on its multi-faceted dissemination and outreach program.

In response to the new organizational structure in the WBG, the team realigned its communications efforts in order to reach target audiences, with particular focus on outreach to the WBG’s newly created Global Practices (GPs). Actions included comprehensive briefings to GP senior management, and a web package and launch event on GPOBA/WBG publication of _Results-based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste_. Another presentation explaining GPOBA to its new Global Practice led to a new knowledge product – WhyOBA? – on the World Bank’s knowledge-sharing platform. GPOBA also held its second annual Inn-OBA-tions awards [link to appendix?], recognizing projects from FY15 that best exemplified successful and innovative implementation of OBA. 

Communications promoted OBA in four key forums: the annual World Water Week in Stockholm, the annual Africa Energy Yearbook, the World Bank’s Solutions Café, which looked at projects supporting sustainable energy access for the poor, and a session on Reaching the Urban Poor at the GPSURR Forum. The team also produced two videos this year – an animated short explaining the benefits of OBA/RBF compared to traditional development financing, and the Honduras Water and Sanitation video, which includes interviews with beneficiaries of this OBA project.

GPOBA’s web presence grew during the year. Improvements to its website and newsletter resulted in an 11 percent increase in unique website visitors, while average newsletter readership increasing by 40 percent. GPOBA also tested a pilot designed to better improve communication with donors through a periodic donor update.

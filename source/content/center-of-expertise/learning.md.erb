This year, GPOBA significantly expanded its educational outreach, rolling out a learning and knowledge exchange strategy that reaches beyond the traditional audience of World Bank practitioners to connect with a range of development partners through both new and existing methodologies and channels.  

GPOBA’s offerings are in the process of being integrated into the World Bank’s Open Learning Campus (OLC) (https://olc.worldbank.org/). The OLC is a state-of-the-art global center for open, interactive development learning for bank staff, clients, and partners across sectors and regions that reached over one million people in FY16. Working with the OLC allows GPOBA to participate in an unparalleled educational environment offering a diverse set of resources, from webinars to instructional video to e-learning courses that concentrate on actionable learning for effective development. 

The OBA/RBF Academy and GPOBA University, both launched in FY16, showcase successes and best practices, while sharing lessons and offering clear educational pathways for those interested in OBA and RBF. Key events for the OBA/RBF Academy in FY16 included the donor learning and knowledge exchange event in Bangladesh with DFID and Sida (see Box 4), the development and delivery of an OBA/RBF Knowledge and Project Clinic with the African Development Bank, and Sida’s Results Based Financing Approaches workshop. The Academy facilitated two South-South knowledge exchanges with client countries and project teams on GPOBA energy project experiences. In a virtual exchange, lessons from renewable energy projects in Bangladesh were shared with the Mali/Sahel Irrigation Initiative for practitioners and stakeholders interested in the institutional arrangements, financing, and technologies piloted under solar irrigation pumps and mini-grids. In Uganda, the governments of Mali and Senegal learned from Uganda’s OBA experience with information and mobilization campaigns in energy projects. Another South-South Knowledge Exchange will take place in East Asia in FY17, when government representatives, implementing agencies, and members of the private sector convene to learn how the Indonesian government’s approach to training, developed with GPOBA’s technical assistance to strengthen independent verification, can be applied to other countries. 

GPOBA University is a repository of best practices, micro-learning resources, and job aids created by and for GPOBA staff for technical learning, day-to-day operations, and knowledge sharing. GPOBA University includes a GPOBA Learning Catalog, which identifies resources available across the World Bank supporting OBA/RBF skills development, and a Learning Path that recommends skills development opportunities.

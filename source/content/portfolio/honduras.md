In Honduras, millions of people lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services. Public and private investment is not enough to finance these services for the poor. A GPOBA project completed in 2013 connected 87,000 low-income residents to water and sanitation services. In this video, residents describe the difference that access to water and sanitation has made in their lives, and representatives of the NGOs involved in the project discuss the benefits of results-based financing.

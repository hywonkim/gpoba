As of June 2016, there are 14 active projects in GPOBA’s subsidy portfolio, and two newly signed grant agreements for energy projects that are in the early stages of implementation , together totaling $108.4 million. Seven of the actively disbursing projects are in the energy sector, three in sanitation, and the others in solid waste management, water and health. Many projects are in the early stages of implementation, while energy projects in Liberia and Uganda, both performing well, are nearing completion, as is the solid waste management project in the West Bank. The Philippines Public Health project, which piloted a voucher system for maternal and reproductive health, was closed in FY16 and lessons learned from this project are under preparation by the team.

Since 2006, GPOBA’s subsidy projects have supported access to basic services for over 9 million people, a 12.5 percent increase over FY15. Subsidy disbursements in FY16 totaled $16.7 million for the year – the third highest level in GPOBA’s history – and raise cumulative disbursements to $132.9 million. 

In keeping with GPOBA’s commitment to serving poor and marginalized communities, many of its investments in subsidy projects are made in countries or contexts that face ongoing challenges due to natural disaster, conflict, political unrest and other complex fragilities. Operational support to project teams is therefore a vital and growing part of GPOBA’s work, and support for two large projects that GPOBA focused on in the previous fiscal year paid dividends this year. The electricity project in Liberia and solid waste management project in the West Bank were on track in FY16, providing services and disbursing subsidies against verified results. GPOBA is continuing to collaborate closely with these project teams to ensure ongoing progress and to gather lessons throughout implementation. Such hands-on support allows GPOBA to grow and share sector, country, and contextual implementation experience, reinforcing its core activities as a Center of Expertise. 

Strong operational support continued in FY16, when many project challenges resulted from technical and political factors, as well as from the continued effects of natural disasters such as the Nepal earthquake and Cyclone Pam in Vanuatu. GPOBA worked closely with task team leaders, operations advisors, practice managers, and project clients to find solutions to problems hindering implementation. The team focused special attention on five projects this fiscal year – sanitation projects in Kenya and Sri Lanka; a solid waste management project in Nepal; and energy projects in Vanuatu and Mali. Operational support – such as technical support for independent verification agents, and project restructuring to respond to significant cost fluctuations related to fluid local conditions and capacity levels – helped projects to get back on track. In Mali, for instance, where the fragile security environment was affecting implementation, close engagement with the client to secure private operators with adequate technical knowledge, along with a customer information campaign on GPOBA-financed connections, helped the project achieve approximately 20 percent of its final connection target in the second half of the fiscal year. Operational support to Mali was supplemented through GPOBA facilitated south-south knowledge sharing amongst governments with OBA experience, which is discussed later in this report.

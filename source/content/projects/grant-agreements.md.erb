Each OBA project has a unique design and financial model for the present context while incorporating lessons learned from prior implementation experience, as well as insights gleaned from technical assistance and knowledge work. This year, two new grant agreements were signed, using this informed approach: 

* Philippines Access to Sustainable Energy. Building on both the World Bank’s and GPOBA’s long-term engagement in the Philippines, which has supported the Government’s establishment of policy and regulatory frameworks and the design of an OBA Solar Energy Facility, this project supports access to renewable energy for poor households in remote communities in the Philippines, mainly in conflict-affected Mindanao. The project is financed by a GPOBA grant of $3 million, from the Sida contribution, as part of the World Bank’s larger Access to Sustainable Energy Project (ASEP), which includes a $12.8 million grant from the European Union under the PV Mainstreaming component. This component of ASEP will reach an estimated 40,500 poor households, benefiting 202,500 people, with the GPOBA contribution accounting for 5,500 households. It will be implemented by LGU Guarantee Corporation in partnership with the private sector under the fee-for-service model, which is aimed at achieving technical and financial sustainability of the solar program. The project aligns with GPOBA’s objectives of providing clean energy solutions, mainstreaming the OBA approach within governments and other development partner systems, and bringing basic services to the poor.

- **Grant Amount**: $3m

- **Donor**: Sida

- **Project Total**: $23.2m

- **Households**: 4,500


*Kenya Electricity Expansion Project-Additional Financing (KEEP-AF). This project follows on from a successful GPOBA pilot implemented under the larger IDA-financed Kenya Electricity Expansion Project (KEEP) that worked with Kenya Power and Lighting Company to support the connection of low-income households in informal settlements to the electricity grid. The new project is part of the World Bank’s KEEP-AF, with the informal settlement electrification component financed by $10.5 million from the IDA and a GPOBA grant of $3 million, funded by Sida. Output-based subsidies will support the connection of an additional 54,000 low-income households in Kenya. The majority of Kenya’s energy comes from renewable sources – geothermal and hydro – and this project supports increased access for poor populations to renewable energy.

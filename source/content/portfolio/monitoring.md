Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) of projects is a crucial part of GPOBA’s ongoing commitment to documenting the effectiveness of OBA. GPOBA regularly tracks the progress of each project toward intermediate outcomes and project objectives, integrating M&E findings into future project design, reporting and sharing best practices with other project teams, OBA practitioners, and development partners.

This year GPOBA produced a range of assessments that supported learning and knowledge-sharing and that reinforced strong coordination between operations and knowledge management. Two Semi-Annual Monitoring Reports analyzed the progress of subsidy projects, TA and dissemination activities. Four [Implementation Completion Reports](http://www.gpoba.org/icrs “Implementation Completion Reports”) (ICRs) were produced – for the Nigeria Pre-paid Health Scheme, the Yemen Safe Motherhood Voucher projects, and OBA for Coverage Expansion in the water sectors in Mozambique and Cameroon. The GPOBA component of the larger IDA-funded Bangladesh Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Project was analyzed as part of the ICR undertaken by the World Bank Group. The ICRs, which are all published on GPOBA’s website, provide a detailed account of the performance and results of each operation in relation to project objectives, design and implementation. For subsidy projects under $5 million, Grant Reporting and Monitoring (GRM) reports are prepared. GPOBA finalized a GRM for the Indonesia telecommunications project, and also produced four project completion reports for water sector projects in Kenya, Uganda, and Indonesia.

A socio-economic impact assessment, which included a gender component, was prepared for the GPOBA Electrification Access project in Ethiopia. The study tracked how electricity provided by this project had changed living patterns in households by freeing up time in the evening for men and women, and also showed that electricity resulted in the number of boys and girls who study in the evening increasing by 15-20 percent.

As a component of GPOBA’s scoping study on education, a Beneficiary Assessment of the Vietnam education project was completed, drawing on qualitative data collected through interviews and focus group discussions, but also incorporating secondary data. The OBA project disbursed subsidies on achievement of pre-approved indicators related to student attendance and educational attainment. Results showed that beneficiaries were on the whole very positive in their assessment of the project, and that overall the project had met its goals of improving enrollment, attendance, and academic performance of poor students in upper-secondary education.

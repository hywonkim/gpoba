I am pleased to present the Annual Report for the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) for the fiscal year 2016 (FY16). GPOBA operates within the World Bank Group’s Global Practice for Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience (SURR).  Our goal at SURR is to build sustainable, inclusive and resilient communities to support the Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and promoting shared prosperity.  GPOBA has worked for over 13 years in 28 countries with almost 50 implementing agencies to develop and deliver results based approaches and solutions that increase access to basic services for poor people across seven sectors, contributing to conditions that promote economic and social development within communities.

GPOBA projects now reach over 9 million people, and this achievement is based on a shared commitment to meaningful results that are achieved through partnership and collaboration.  The fundamental element of this partnership is with donors and development partners.  GPOBA’s project development collaborations reach across the World Bank Group, connecting technical and operational staff beyond our own SURR Global Practice, to those in Water and Sanitation, Energy, Health, Education, Transport, and Poverty, the cross cutting areas of Public-Private Partnerships, Fragility, Conflict and Violence, Gender and Climate Change, as well as staff from the International Finance Corporation.  

GPOBA’s projects touch 11 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which are the core of the World Bank’s operational engagement. By design, they incorporate tailored solutions to development challenges that must align with the agreed strategies of member countries, and meet donor priorities. Many of the projects are either developed in or face fragile contexts, due to challenges from weak capacity, political unrest, violence or climate related disasters. Against this backdrop, GPOBA projects continue to deliver results, expand into new areas and generate knowledge and collaboration opportunities contributing to our goals.  

SURR recognizes the importance of partnerships and continues to develop these as fundamental to realizing our goals.  Our Partnership and Resource Mobilization Unit, headed by Carmen Nonay, continues to provide strategic management for GPOBA, one of our largest partnership programs.  In the year ahead, we expect to continue steady progress with growing leverage in partnership programs and in engagement with development partners across the spectrum.

Grant funding is a critical element of GPOBA’s mission, serving as the catalyst for design and implementation of OBA
projects. GPOBA grants provide operational support for subsidy projects, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge dissemination. Monitoring and evaluating project performance is a key part of the team’s work, with project completion reports, evaluations, and assessments all informing the design of future pilot projects and contributing to GPOBA’s development as a Center of Expertise on the use of OBA/RBF.

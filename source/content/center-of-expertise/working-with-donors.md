GPOBA works with other development partners, governments, and the World Bank Group to mainstream OBA approaches. Technical and advisory initiatives supporting the design and implementation of projects, awareness building, and knowledge management were key elements of the mainstreaming effort during this fiscal year.

As part of an ongoing collaboration with the Asian Development Bank (ADB) and Sida, GPOBA participated in a workshop organized by the ADB in Thailand to share operational knowledge on the application of OBA financing in the energy sector. The workshop was attended by representatives of government institutions and utilities from Asian countries. In Washington, DC, GPOBA and the World Bank Group organized training sessions for staff of the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) on OBA core concepts and lessons learned from design and implementation of OBA projects for grid and off-grid energy access. Future areas of cooperation discussed with MCC included GPOBA support for MCC operations in the energy and water sectors. Sida hosted in-depth discussions in Stockholm with its results-based approach project team and GPOBA, during which GPOBA presented findings from its recent study on the current RBF context, players and instruments. In addition, GPOBA presented to a general Sida audience on OBA/RBF and project experience.

GPOBA worked with select governments in FY15 to scale-up successful pilots and mainstream OBA approaches. This included grant agreement signings with the governments of Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda for expanding successful OBA pilots, and ongoing work with the governments of Nepal and the Philippines for OBA facilities in energy and water.

In addition, GPOBA and the World Bank’s Leadership, Learning and Innovation group held a workshop on OBA/RBF and Social Impact Bonds for the Polish, Czech and Lithuanian governments. The workshop built participants’ understanding of OBA and results-based initiatives in order to develop project concepts for increasing access to basic services, including clean energy, education, and employment training for marginalized communities. GPOBA also provided technical training in Indonesia for the Local Government and Decentralization Project to strengthen the verification component of the program, which uses an output-based disbursement approach<!-- (see Box 4) -->.

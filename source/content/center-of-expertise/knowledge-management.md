GPOBA’s knowledge management activities and products are key to the ongoing coordination between operations and knowledge functions. The team works to capture and facilitate knowledge flows, develop new knowledge tools, and disseminate knowledge products. It also focuses on fostering interpersonal networks both internally and externally. The knowledge strategy uses the Knowledge Management, Learning and Innovation (KMLI) approach, in which knowledge is addressed through four components: content management, collaboration, technical learning, and innovation. GPOBA utilizes quarterly metric indicator reports to determine the success of knowledge traction, flow and dissemination.

A range of publications draws on experience gained from GPOBA’s portfolio of projects, presenting information that feeds back into future investments and operations. The **OBApproaches** series discusses OBA design and implementation, either through individual projects or through a thematic focus. In FY15, GPOBA produced five OBApproaches: OBA in Fragile and Conflict Situations; Experiences with Commercial Financing of Water and Sanitation in Kenya[?]; Mali Rural Electrification; Philippines Heath; and OBA and Solid Waste Management [link to these on GPOBA website] The **Lessons Learned** series is based on findings following project completion. Five issues were produced in FY15: Bangladesh Solar Homes Systems; Ethiopia Electricity; Nepal Biogas; Vietnam Water; and Mumbai electricity. [link to LL on GPOBA website] The Mumbai note, which explained the challenges faced in implementing the electricity project, won the GPSURR award for Best Documentation of Failure. The team also contributed to the report, _Surge in Solar-Powered Homes: Experience in Off-grid Rural Bangladesh_, which reported on the positive effects SHSs have had on health outcomes, study hours, and security.

As part of its ongoing work, GPOBA produces tools to transfer knowledge from OBA experts to practitioners. Highlights for the year included:

**Universe of RBF study:** This study develops a baseline of information on RBF, mapping the major actors, analyzing trends and instruments, and capturing relevant international events. As well as expanding GPOBA’s knowledge of RBF, the study generated opportunities for GPOBA to collaborate with and learn from other RBF practitioners. Link here to box on RBF?

**Results-Based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste:** A joint report launched by GPOBA and the Work Bank, this global study analyzes projects in eight countries that applied RBF approaches in the solid waste management sector. Two of the projects studied were active GPOBA-funded pilots in the West Bank and Nepal. Link here to RBF in SWM box?

**Development Challenges/Solutions Approaches** **(DCSA):** This WBG-led initiative links knowledge and operations through the DCSA solutions platform. The DCSA provides clients and decision-makers with interactive and timely project approaches and potential solutions. GPOBA contributed a DCSA, ‘How can countries incentivize public and private providers to extend basic services to the urban and rural poor?’, drawing on lessons from Uganda health, Morocco water and sanitation, and Kenya community water projects.

**Options Paper for Water Sector Regulation in the Philippines:** This paper derived from TA provided to the Government of the Philippines (GoP) in the water sector. It considered models of regulation in the sector and made recommendations to the GoP on which forms of regulation would be appropriate in the Philippine context.  

1. Fostering the OBA/RBF community remains an important component of GPOBA’s development as a knowledge and expertise hub. GPOBA’s **Community of Practice (CoP)** provides space for OBA/RBF practitioners to share best practices through peer learning, knowledge exchange, cross-sectoral collaboration, and networking. GPOBA expanded its CoP collaboration activities by moving to an online space on the World Bank’s Collaboration for Development (C4D) platform. Membership of the CoP has increased 33 percent in the past year, with a total of 331 members, 44 percent of whom are external to the Bank. In FY15, events hosted on the CoP platform included the Successful Utility Reform in Water Supply and Sanitation Workshop in Nairobi, two sessions during World Bank Water Week on solar water pumping and urban water supply and sanitation, and the OBA Inn-OBA-tions Awards [link to awards appendix-here?].

1. Another important element of GPOBA’s knowledge-sharing toolkit, **webinars** are hosted by subject matter experts and facilitate dialogue among senior OBA specialists, thought leaders in the field, and strategic partners. Four webinars in FY15 focused on the water, irrigation, energy, climate change, and solid waste sectors.

1. In FY15, GPOBA launched or maintained a range of knowledge repositories to help GPOBA staff in their everyday work. These included: a sharepoint repository of knowledge assets (knowGPOBA); a project document repository containing full audits of active projects (PATs2.0); a collaborative space for GPOBA staff for discussion and dialogue (talkGPOBA); and a knowledge space on the WBG’s collaborative platform to supplement GPOBA trainings (WhyOBA?).

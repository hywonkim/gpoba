[quote]GPOBA achieved a major milestone in FY15, reaching eight million people with access to basic infrastructure and services.[/quote] Disbursements for subsidy projects in FY15 totaled $10 million, bringing cumulative disbursements to $116.3 million since the inception of the subsidy program in 2006. Three subsidy projects were completed in FY15–Solar PV Systems in Ghana, Bangladesh Solar Home Systems, and Extending Telecommunications in Rural Indonesia–raising the number of successfully completed subsidy projects to 28. Demonstration effects are not limited to closed projects and this is well illustrated by an ongoing project with the Kenya Power and Light Corporation GPOBA project that is successfully delivering safe, legal electricity connections to households in Nairobi’s informal settlements<!-- jumpnav to box? -->.

Each of the GPOBA subsidy projects completed in FY15 has contributed to the country’s experience in using results based approaches to solve critical national development issues and all are implementing additional projects using an OBA approach. These include projects with GPOBA and the World Bank for sanitation in Ghana and additional off grid clean energy and irrigation in Bangladesh; and, with other development
partners for water in Indonesia. These follow-on projects illustrate the powerful demonstration effect of initial OBA subsidy projects for the delivery of basic services.

One of GPOBA’s priorities for the year was to provide operational support to existing subsidy projects that faced serious external challenges including an earthquake, the Ebola outbreak, localized political tensions, and significant fluctuations in local economic conditions. Many of these challenges arose in already fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS)<!-- jumpnav to box? -->. These important project support efforts focused on working with teams to understand the short, medium and long term effects of these events and adapt as needed to adjust or resume services as quickly as possible. Seven projects facing impediments to implementation. The projects were located in Kenya, Liberia, Nepal, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Uganda, and the West Bank. Operational support was wide- ranging, and included project adaptation, restructuring, capacity-building of municipalities and independent verification agents, and even reconstructing healthcare facilities in the Philippines that had been destroyed by Typhoon Yolanda the previous year.

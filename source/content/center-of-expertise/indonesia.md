One of GPOBA’s largest TA activities to date is the support for the Independent Verification Agent (IVA) in the World Bank’s Local Government and Decentralization Project (LGDP) in Indonesia. The LGDP includes an output-based disbursement approach, in which a portion of the Indonesian government’s specific purpose grants for infrastructure sub-sectors is reimbursed following verification of specified outputs. The IVA in this case is the Indonesian National Government Internal Auditor (BPKP).

The GPOBA grant provides (i) capacity building and technical assistance to the IVA to strengthen monitoring and evaluation of outputs using GPOBA methodological materials, and (ii) technical assistance to strengthen municipal management and raise citizen awareness of government accountability. So far, 213 BPKP staff have been trained. To ensure that knowledge is retained and disseminated within BPKP offices, it is planned that the training methodology will be institutionalized within BPKP’s training center curriculum, which will enable the replication of the technical training for wider audiences. An important output from this TA is the development of two verification handbooks for BPKP and local government that make clear the quality required in infrastructure in order to pass IVA inspection. 

Through this TA, GPOBA is piloting an approach in which government auditors are converted to IVAs, supported and monitored by civil society. GPOBA plans to apply the experiences and lessons learned from this project to other projects and sectors in Indonesia and in other countries.

With the addition of five new grant agreements signed in FY15, GPOBA’s portfolio of subsidy projects grew to 44. The subsidy portfolio focuses on provision of basic services to the poor, with 82 percent of funding going to IDA countries and 8 percent to IDA blended countries. There are sixteen active projects under implementation, with a total of $106.5 million in commitments.

Access to energy and water are crucial in alleviating extreme poverty, and the energy sector currently receives the largest share of GPOBA subsidies, with 43 percent of the project portfolio. Water is the second largest sector in the portfolio, followed by health. Solid waste management is a growing sector for GPOBA. Geographically, sub- Saharan Africa has the largest share of funding, followed by South Asia (Figure 5).

GPOBA also has a significant cumulative portfolio of TA and knowledge activities, with 177 projects totaling $28 million. TA support for RBF activities is wide ranging and includes work with the World Bank’s Program for Results (PforR), which links disbursement of funds to governments to the achievement of specific program results. GPOBA has provided TA for five PforR operations: Ethiopia (urban), Tanzania (education), Brazil (multi-sectoral), Mexico (water and sanitation) and Uruguay (transport), the latter four projects were active in FY15. GPOBA’s RBF activities have indirectly benefitted approximately 3 million people. Both TA and knowledge activities are reported in more detail throughout this report.

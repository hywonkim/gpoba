This is a time of renewed challenge and great opportunity in working to achieve fundamental elements in the world’s development agenda.  The sustainable development goals have provided ambitious and necessary targets for collective effort.  Governments, development partners and communities don’t have resources or time to waste in connecting basic services where they are needed most.  Service providers, large and small, recognize the need for their services and opportunity to expand their markets. New advocates and funders are emerging, looking for measurable social and other impacts to frame their participation, whether in developing markets or as applied to complex issues in more economically developed contexts.  

Results based approaches, including output-based aid, are becoming ever more relevant for all of these constituencies, helping to link needs, objectives and actual results.  GPOBA has a depth of experience in design, development and project implementation across seven sectors, meanwhile pushing to expand the application of OBA and RBF to new areas, such as mini-grids and solar irrigation in Bangladesh, housing in Kenya and India, and the garment sector in Bangladesh.  We also innovate by applying elements of the approach in ways that make service delivery more efficient and effective, as in improving results from government’s infrastructure grants in Indonesia and bringing gender considerations into the provision of basic services like lighting and sanitation.  GPOBA is attractive to many of these constituencies through a combination of incentives, examples and know-how from experience in reaching previously underserved communities, as well as lessons learned from projects that were not successful. Our work and opportunities continue to grow, and the year ahead promises to be a positive challenge for continued partnership, scale up and expanded collaboration in OBA and the universe of RBF.

Over the years, OBA projects have utilized a range of approaches, each one with a unique design and financial model, and incorporating lessons learned from previous experience. All new project proposals come before an independent Panel of Experts (PoE) at two stages of their preparation:

**Eligibility**: An initial assessment to ensure that the project meets GPOBA’s eligibility criteria, which include the country and sector, project sustainability, and the number of poor people expected to receive services.

**Commitment**: A review of the project to determine whether it is ready for implementation and that, in its final form, it continues to meet the eligibility criteria. Since GPOBA is administered by the World Bank, projects going to commitment undergo fiduciary reviews with respect to financial management and procurement, along with assessments of environmental and social impacts, in accordance with World Bank policy.

### Zambia Rural Electrification

### Kenya Water OBA Fund Scale-up
**Scaling up access to water in Kenya**: This project is a scale-up of a successful financing mechanism piloted with community water projects in Kenya. The project will help county water services providers access loan finance from local commercial banks to fund subprojects to improve access to water and sanitation services in low-income areas. A GPOBA grant of $11.84 million, funded by Sida, will benefit 30,000 low-income households under this initiative.

### Uganda Reproductive Health Voucher Program Scale-up
**Improving maternal health in Uganda**: This scale-up project builds on the successful reproductive health voucher pilot program launched in 2007, which assisted in the safe delivery of 65,590 babies and provided reproductive health care services to more than 136,000 women in rural Ugandan communities. The new five-year project, funded by a $13.3 million grant from Sida, will use vouchers to subsidize the cost of maternal and reproductive health care for poor women. It will be implemented by Uganda’s Ministry of Health, and is expected to contribute to over 132,000 safe deliveries. The project builds national capacity to mainstream the safe delivery voucher scheme in the health sector.

The project, supported by a $15 million grant from DFID, as well as the World Bank Group, the Government of Bangladesh, and other development partners, will target poor households in remote areas. Project implementation will be gender-inclusive, with service providers targeting local women in marketing strategies and customer trainings, and consulting them during the installation process.

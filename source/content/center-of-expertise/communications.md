GPOBA’s ongoing communications strategy aims to position OBA in the context of RBF and the results agendas of development partners, as well as in the broader international discussion on aid effectiveness and innovative finance. In FY15, the communications team built on its multi-faceted dissemination and outreach program, and focused on improving GPOBA’s visibility and profile within the World Bank Group and externally, highlighting GPOBA’s relevance during the World Bank’s organizational restructuring. In response to the new structure, the team realigned its communications efforts in order to reach target audiences, with particular focus on outreach to the newly created global practices (GPs) within the World Bank. Comprehensive briefings were delivered to GP senior management, and a web package was developed for the launch of GPOBA/World Bank publication of Results-Based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste. A presentation explaining GPOBA to its new global practice led to a new knowledge product – whyOBA? – on the World Bank’s knowledge-sharing platform.

The communications team also promoted OBA in other key venues, including the annual Africa Energy Yearbook; a session on Reaching the Urban Poor at the GPSURR Forum; the World Bank’s Solutions Café, which looked at projects supporting sustainable energy access for the poor; and the second annual Inn-OBA-tions Awards, which recognized projects from FY15 that best exemplified successful and innovative implementation of OBA. (See Appendix E). GPOBA produced two videos this year –  explaining [the benefits of OBA/RBF](https://www.gpoba.org/video.developmentfinancingforresults) compared to traditional development financing and [improvements to lives in Honduras](https://www.gpoba.org/video.honduras.water) via water and sanitation, which includes interviews with local residents benefitting from this OBA project.

    <span itemprop="name" content="Partnership in Honduras: Output-Based Aid in Water and Sanitation"></span>
    <span itemprop="description" content="In Honduras, millions of people lack access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation services. Current public and private investment is not enough to provide the poor with access to these basic services. Through an innovative, results-based financing mechanism called output-based aid, the World Bank, the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) and the Government of Honduras connected 87,000 low-income residents to water and sanitation services. This video includes testimonials from beneficiaries, who describe the hardships they faced and the difference that access to water and sanitation made in their lives. Representatives from the NGOs involved in the project explain the benefits of financing projects through output-based aid, and the role the communities played in connecting low-income residents. Linking incentives to results, OBA has improved health and increased access to water and sanitation services, making water a priority for the poor."></span>

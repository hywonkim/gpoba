Analytical studies are a key component of GPOBA’s work in testing the applicability of OBA/RBF in new sectors and environments. In FY16, GPOBA finalized one scoping study in urban transport and initiated three other studies, all of which assess how and where OBA/RBF approaches are most feasible and could have the highest potential for impact, and how possible interventions align with GPOBA’s objectives and capacities, as well as with broader sector needs. They determine how OBA/RBF may form part of development finance solutions, aiming particularly at reaching the poor, who are often overlooked in large urban infrastructure initiatives. 

**Urban Transport.** Over the last decade there has been increased interest in public investment in urban mass transit, with implementation of urban rail and bus rapid-transit projects. However, there is little indication of the extent to which the poor are benefiting from these interventions. In FY16, GPOBA completed the Urban Transport study, undertaken in collaboration with the World Bank’s Transport Global Practice. The study analyzed how OBA approaches can help to address the urban transport access challenge for low-income populations in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Three cities in Africa and Asia were identified where OBA schemes are thought to have the highest potential for success and would yield the most telling lessons. Project concepts were developed for pilots in these cities. In addition, the study evaluated options for an integrated public transport fare and subsidy policy and developed a tool to help authorities assess transport investment and financing options that focus on access for the poor. In parallel with this study, a TA activity is assessing the potential for OBA in a City Bus Access project in Thimphu, Bhutan (see under Technical Assistance).

GPOBA is conducting two studies in collaboration with the World Bank’s Urban Analytics Innovation Lab. The Urban Infrastructure study is assessing demand for urban infrastructure services by tracking variations across sectors and cities; it will propose improved methodology for incorporating data on levels and types of demand into the design of urban and infrastructure projects. The Affordable Housing study is reviewing the global experience of private sector involvement in the provision of affordable housing; the aim is to propose a framework for partnering with the private sector to deliver affordable housing using OBA/RBF approaches. These two studies are discussed in greater detail in Box 2. GPOBA is also leading a knowledge initiative on the operational experience of applying OBA and results-based climate-financing instruments in climate-related sectors; this work is being done in collaboration with the World Bank’s Climate Change Cross-cutting Solutions Area. The initiative has assessed experiences across sectors, focusing on cities, with the overarching objective of fostering knowledge exchange and learning on the applicability of OBA/RBF in urban climate-resilient development.

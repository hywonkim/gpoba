In Kenya, economic conditions continue to improve but access to basic services is still a challenge. Only about half the population has access to clean water, and sewerage coverage is 16 percent. Investment in the rehabilitation and expansion of water supply systems is hindered by inadequate public funds. A potential source of financing is private sector lending to utilities, an option that faces challenges of its own: traditionally, banks have not seen the water sector as financially viable, while water utilities tend to have limited collateral and are unfamiliar with commercial lending practices. 

For the last several years, the World Bank and its partners have been working with the Government of Kenya to increase the viability of water supply projects to enable them to access domestic loan finance, and three OBA projects are using output-based subsidies and a blended finance instrument to improve water and sanitation access for Kenya’s poor. These interventions are expected to help water service providers access $30 million to $40 million in commercial loans for infrastructure, while making pro-poor sewerage and water connections financially viable.

The Nairobi Sanitation Project will connect 16,000 low-income households to the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company (NCWSC) network. NCWSC has obtained a commercial loan to finance the project, and an OBA grant will reimburse the company up to 70 percent of the cost of sewerage and 40 percent of the cost of water connections. NCWSC will recuperate the balance through upfront connection fees and monthly billing surcharges for up to five years. 

The **Kenya Urban Water and Sanitation OBA Fund for Low Income Areas** is also supporting access to commercial finance. The Water Services Trust Fund of Kenya (WSTF), a state corporation that invests in pro-poor water and sanitation infrastructure, is implementing this program, which provides grants to service providers that access commercial loans for investment. Under the OBA Fund, subprojects are prefinanced with loans from domestic lenders that support investments in household water and sewer connections, public water kiosks, and public toilets. An OBA grant buys down 60 percent of the subproject cost financed by domestic lenders. The project will support provision of water and sanitation for 30,000 households. 

These projects built on lessons learned from GPOBA’s successful **Kenya Microfinance for Community Water Projects**, where GPOBA worked with the World Bank’s Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility and the Water and Sanitation Program, and with Kenya’s K-Rep Bank to increase access to clean water for 190,00 rural residents. The program and its subsequent scale-up helped 35 community water projects access loan finance and mobilized equity for investment in water facilities.

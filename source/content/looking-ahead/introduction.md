At a strategy workshop in Paris in June, 2015, GPOBA gathered with donors to assess the year’s progress and to identify activities and priorities for the coming year. The donors acknowledged the continuing significance of GPOBA’s work in scoping, designing, supporting, and implementing OBA pilots, and went on to endorse GPOBA’s proposal to expand its activities to other RBF instruments. This will be a significant step, and GPOBA will be looking closely at which RBF mechanisms align most effectively with its knowledge, experience, and objectives, and with donor priorities. 

GPOBA’s vision for the coming year will continue to focus on supporting OBA/RBF approaches for service delivery to the poor. GPOBA will work to move forward projects already in the pipeline, placing increased emphasis on growing the evidence base related to pilot projects in order to further the proof of concept for OBA/RBF. It will also continue to move toward becoming a Center of Expertise, an ongoing process that responds and adjusts to client needs, changing contexts, and an evolving portfolio. Emphasis on monitoring and evaluation will be strengthened by the development of a results framework that will enable more systematized performance evaluation of OBA/RBF project objectives and impacts, evidence that will be integrated into ongoing and future project design. 

GPOBA’s work will align strongly with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which come into effect in FY16. The SDGs focus on partnership and the interconnection of social, economic, and environmental issues, with eight of the 17 goals incorporating indicators associated with access to basic services, in several sectors covered by GPOBA. Multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund have developed a set of four categorical financing solutions – one of which is RBF – to meet the investment needs of the SDGs.

Testing innovative approaches in a development context carries risks and necessarily involves setbacks. As GPOBA moves into FY16, it remains committed to supporting results-based solutions in both new and untested sectors and regions, and to convening development partners, practitioners, and governments for sharing knowledge and experience on OBA/RBF as it works to deliver basic services to the poor.

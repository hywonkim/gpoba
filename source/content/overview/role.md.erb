GPOBA is a global partnership created in 2003 by the UK’s Department for International Development and the World Bank, and administered by the World Bank. Originally designed to help prepare OBA projects and document and disseminate lessons learned, GPOBA began funding subsidy schemes in 2006 through additional donor contributions. OBA pilots have been implemented in urban, peri-urban, and rural areas, employing public and private operators, public-private partnerships (PPPs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and community organizations as implementing agencies and service providers. 

GPOBA’s vision focuses on two primary objectives: that OBA approaches be regularly incorporated into the design of infrastructure and social services projects to support sustainable delivery of basic services to target populations, and that GPOBA become a recognized Center of Expertise (CoE), building on the knowledge and experience gained through testing OBA approaches to extract lessons and document sector-wide best practices. 

With the recent WBG restructuring, more focus is being placed on knowledge – extracting, documenting, and sharing it both internally and with other development partners – which strongly aligns with GPOBA’s objective of becoming a CoE. GPOBA’s transition from the Finance, Economics and Urban Development Department to the Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice (GPSURR) is ideal, as SURR is the WBG’s nexus for sustainable, inclusive and resilient communities and basic services. GPOBA continues to work across sectors and partnerships, currently supporting nearly half the new GPs.

The report that follows reviews GPOBA’s progress towards its objectives during the last fiscal year, July 1, 2014-June 30, 2015. You will find tables and appendices of projects in GPOBA’s portfolio, as well as links to knowledge publications, videos, and information on individual projects.

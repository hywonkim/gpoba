In 2015, a financing framework for water and sanitation in the Philippines was finalized and delivered to the Government of the Philippines (GoP). The ‘Philippines Water Supply and Sanitation Unified Financing Framework’ was led by the World Bank’s GP for Water and co-financed by GPOBA and the Australian government. It reviews the main challenges in the sector, existing financial resources, and the needs of water and sanitation providers. It also draws on lessons from innovative financing strategies in other countries to propose a framework for increasing financing and water service coverage in the country. The framework proposes commercial financing for investment in utilities and water districts, supported by grants for a viability gap fund and OBA subsidies to connect poor households. The proposal has been discussed with the GoP, and is to be reviewed by the National Economic and Development Authority (NEDA). The World Bank intends to support the rollout of the UFF once the GoP has selected implementation modalities.

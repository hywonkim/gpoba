GPOBA’s subsidy portfolio focuses on supporting access to basic services for poor and marginalized populations. With the signing of two new grant agreements in FY16, GPOBA now has 46 subsidy projects totaling $234 million in its portfolio, with 63 percent of subsidy funding going to IDA countries and 24 percent to IDA blended countries.  

GPOPA works in seven sectors: energy, water, health, sanitation, solid waste management, education, and telecoms. For FY16, energy remains the largest sector in the portfolio at 44 percent, and water is the second largest sector at 24 percent; GPOBA’s work in the sanitation sector is growing rapidly. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest percentage of GPOBA funding by region, at 52 percent, followed by the South Asia at 20 percent, and East Asia at 12 percent. Details of the distribution of the overall portfolio are presented in figure 5.
Technical assistance (TA) and knowledge dissemination activities are the other components of GPOBA’s overall portfolio. TA enables GPOBA to lay the foundations for future project design, build capacity among partners and governments, and test the applicability of OBA/RBF in new sectors and environments. In FY16, five new TA activities totaling $903,000 were launched in the energy, transport, social development, and solid waste management sectors. The insights and experience gained from TA initiatives contribute to GPOBA’s knowledge base and are shared with other OBA/RBF practitioners. Highlights and details of the TA and knowledge components of GPOBA’s work are covered in later sections of this report.

[^1] The International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. Countries that lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and those with per capita gross national income below $1,215 are eligible for IDA support. Countries that are IDA-eligible based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some IBRD borrowings are referred to as ‘blend’ countries.

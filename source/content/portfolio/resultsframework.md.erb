To strengthen the understanding of how, where, and when OBA projects have succeeded, and to provide the foundation for monitoring and evaluation (M&E) work going forward, GPOBA developed a results framework, presented in Figure 6. An important tool for planning and accountability, the results framework will enable the team to coordinate program development efforts and track the achievement of strategic objectives. It will also ensure that data is collected and analyzed in a consistent way, a key to successful project implementation and to GPOBA’s ability to share useful information with its partners. 

The results framework is built on a review of GPOBA’s activities from 2003-2016, using M&E frameworks utilized by OBA projects, internal evaluation reports from GPOBA and the World Bank, and other published literature. It links activities funded by GPOBA with their expected chain of results – outputs and intermediate outcomes – and describes how results are aligned with broader overarching goals set by the World Bank, governments, and the donor community, and with the SDGs. It also highlights key differences in tracking output/results-based approaches and those based on inputs. 

In FY16, a database was established, containing all the indicators that can be collected, measured, and reported through the lifecycle of OBA projects. Discussions are taking place around issues raised by early portfolio review results, including the possibilities for more wide-ranging use of IVAs, more effective integration of collected data into government or private sector monitoring systems, and the potential for tracking performance of service provision after initial installation.

Emerging lessons and knowledge will be combined with deeper country case studies to identify approaches and techniques that can inform future OBA/RBF programs – findings that GPOBA will develop and share with partners through events and publications.

Grant funding is a critical element of GPOBA’s mission, providing the catalyst for design and implementation of RBF projects. GPOBA provides operational support for subsidy projects, technical assistance (TA), and knowledge dissemination. Monitoring and measuring project performance is a key part of the team’s work. Project completion reports, evaluations, and assessments all inform the design of future pilot projects and contribute to GPOBA’s objective of becoming a recognized Center of Expertise (CoE) on the use of OBA/RBF.

FY15 was a strong year for GPOBA, with five new grant agreements signed for subsidy projects and eight new TA activities initiated in support of OBA/RBF projects. There was a focus on scaling up successful OBA projects and mainstreaming OBA and RBF approaches in cooperation with governments and other development partners. 

GPOBA initiated a new team structure during the year, with project leads now responsible for supporting activities from concept stage through grant closure, rather than handing off projects upon implementation to the former Portfolio Team. This change increases accountability, knowledge flow, and consistency, allowing clients to maintain the same point of contact for the life of a project. 

Below are some highlights of GPOBA’s year: 

- As of June 2015, the GPOBA cumulative portfolio consists of **44 grant agreements in seven sectors in the amount of $228 million**. Three projects closed in FY15, bringing to 28 the total number of closed projects in GPOBA’s portfolio from which valuable lessons are being drawn. 
- **GPOBA disbursed a total of $10 million in FY15 for subsidy projects**, bringing cumulative disbursements since 2006 to $116.3 million. [link to table of cumulative disbursements?]
- **Five new grant** **agreements were signed** for a total of $49.9 million, including 3 scale-ups of successful GPOBA pilots in Kenya, Uganda, and Bangladesh, and the first OBA project to be undertaken in Zambia.
- **Eight new TA activities were approved**, totaling $1.4 million; ten new activities focusing on knowledge dissemination were undertaken for $1.7 million

The Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA) has had a year of important transition and growth, as we continue to expand our reach and development impact. With support from our donors and through partnerships with 18 governments and 33 service providers, we have now delivered basic services to over eight million people. This achievement is a significant milestone for GPOBA, and represents a 14 percent increase from fiscal year 2014.

The Annual Report for fiscal year 2015 (FY15) details GPOBA’s work toward fulfilling its mandate to fund, design, demonstrate, and document OBA approaches to service delivery. During FY15, we balanced our ongoing commitment to deepening the impact of OBA in tested sectors with exploring the applicability of OBA in new sectors and environments. GPOBA’s $228 million subsidy portfolio now comprises 44 projects in seven sectors in 28 countries, with cumulative disbursements of $116.3 million. Three of the five grant agreements signed were scale-ups of successful OBA projects in the energy and water sectors, including the $15 million renewable energy scale-up in Bangladesh, which underscores GPOBA’s commitment to clean energy.

GPOBA continued to expand technical assistance and knowledge activities, key to our work as a Center of Expertise. FY15 saw disbursements of $4.8 million for these activities, with 18 new projects, bringing the total TA and knowledge portfolio to 177 projects for over $28 million.

Activities included project structuring advice to development partners and governments; three major studies on the Universe of Results- Based Financing, which developed a baseline of information on RBF actors, trends, and instruments, a global study on Results-Based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste, and a major education scoping study; as well as many convening and knowledge events, both face to face and through an increasing web presence, the Community of Practice and new knowledge-sharing platform.

Cultivating and maintaining a culture of partnership is critical to GPOBA’s work. GPOBA is proud to be part of SURR’s new Partnership and Resource Mobilization Unit, headed by Carmen Nonay. Carmen continues to lead the overall strategic direction of GPOBA, and in FY15 was joined by Catherine Commander O’Farrell, first as deputy manager and then as head of GPOBA operations.

The year’s accomplishments are possible thanks to the financial and strategic support of our donors. As GPOBA moves into FY16, it remains committed to developing and supporting results-based solutions in both new and untested sectors and to convening development partners, practitioners, and governments to share knowledge and experience on OBA/RBF. We look forward to continued work together to deliver basic services to poor populations, supporting social inclusion and enabling participation in wider economic growth.

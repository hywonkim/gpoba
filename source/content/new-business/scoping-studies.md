Scoping studies are a key part of GPOBA’s commitment to testing the applicability of OBA/RBF in new sectors and environments. These studies help to determine how and where OBA/RBF interventions might be most effective, and whether they align strategically with GPOBA’s objectives and capacities. In FY15, GPOBA completed a major scoping study in education. This study situated OBA within the broader context of RBF in education to determine how OBA approaches can increase access to quality education in developing countries. The study included early childhood development, primary, secondary, post-secondary, non-tertiary, and lifelong learning, with particular emphasis on the education of poor populations, girls, and disadvantaged groups.

Based on an in-depth analysis of 24 projects that have applied an OBA approach, the study identified key factors that support successful OBA interventions in education and made recommendations for GPOBA involvement in the sector. The study showed that OBA is a versatile tool that can address issues in education related to access, quality, and system inefficiencies. Government support and buy-in are important to a project’s potential for sustainability, and engagement with government is therefore key to project success. In the education sector, where the overall evidence base on the effectiveness and impact of results-based approaches remains relatively limited, projects should ensure that evaluations are incorporated into design and implementation.

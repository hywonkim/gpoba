At a strategy workshop in Paris in June 2015, GPOBA gathered with donors to assess progress and agree the strategic direction of future activities, based on the findings of the independent evaluation and donor direction. GPOBA’s vision and work is clearly relevant to current development goals and the broader RBF community, which has grown significantly since the establishment of GPOBA in 2003. Donors agreed that the scope of GPOBA’s work going forward should include the OBA approach and expansion of RBF work beyond project structuring into dissemination and, should additional funding become available, into selected subsidy projects. In addition, GPOBA will increase its focus as a Center of Expertise, increasing evidence based monitoring and evaluation, extracting deeper lessons from the portfolio and working to reach a more global audience, through collaboration, convening and other platforms.

[quote]GPOBA’s results focus, project experience and related implementation knowledge provide a powerful platform for expanded collaboration with donors, governments and civil society.[/quote] This platform is particularly relevant in the transition from the Millennium Development Goals to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which frames development agendas for the future. GPOBA’s work aligns with the SDGs through the interconnection of social, economic, and environmental issues. Eight of the 17 goals incorporate indicators linked with access to basic services in sectors covered by GPOBA, including energy and water, and the final goal focused on partnership itself. RBF is one of the four financing solutions presented by multilateral development banks and the International Monetary Fund to meet the investment needs of the SDGs. GPOBA offers the methodology and practical experience used to reach over 8 million people as one tool for achieving the SDGs for the benefit of all.

Innovation is about finding and applying new ways to address existing problems and accelerate development impact. In FY16, GPOBA continued to incentivize innovation in the application of OBA/RBF through the use of creative financing mechanisms, new technologies, and new collaborations and partnerships. Here are three of the ways GPOBA supported innovation in FY16. 

GPOBA is working on two studies with the Urban Analytics Innovation Lab. The World Bank’s Innovation Labs offer demand-driven, cutting-edge approaches to development challenges. A study on urban infrastructure is assessing supply and demand for infrastructure services by examining variations across sectors and cities in Kenya, and proposing improved methods for incorporating supply and demand considerations into project design. Identification of an OBA/RBF urban infrastructure pilot is planned in the coming year. GPOBA is also working with the Urban Analytics Innovation Lab on affordable housing, reviewing involvement of the private sector in affordable housing in Kenya and India. The team will propose options for development of pilots for affordable housing projects in one or two cities using OBA/RBF approaches. The potential for increasing low-income access to quality urban housing through the OBA model were shared at a panel discussion, ‘Shaping the City Parcel by Parcel: PPPs in Urban Land Development’, organized by the World Bank’s Urban Development Strategy and Analytics.

GPOBA held its third annual Inn-OBA-tions Awards to recognize World Bank projects that use OBA/RBF in innovative ways. The Pioneer Award went to the Solid Waste Management (SWM) (https://www.gpoba.org/award-pioneer) pilot in the West Bank, the first PPP in the Palestinian territories and the first SWM project using OBA; it is improving SWM in a challenging environment affected by conflict and violence, while expanding the potential for OBA beyond traditional sectors, partners, and country contexts. The Uganda Grid Based OBA Facility: Energy for Rural Transformation II (https://www.gpoba.org/award-collaboration) won the Collaboration Award. Based on a PPP between the Government of Uganda and service providers and on strong collaboration with the World Bank/IDA, GPOBA, and KfW, the project supports improved access to electricity for poor households in peri-urban and rural areas. The Social Inclusion/Green Award was given to the Moldova Biomass Heating and Energy Conservation Project, the first to issue Certified Emission Reductions (CERs) in Moldova, (https://www.gpoba.org/award-social.inclusion-green) with revenues from sales of CERs reinvested in energy efficiency improvements. Utilizing the innovative RBF mechanism linked to Green House Gas mitigation, the project improves heating services of public buildings in poor rural communities.  The Indonesia Local Government and Decentralization Project (https://www.gpoba.org/award-governance) won the Governance Award. The project improves reporting and accountability in central government grants for basic infrastructure, while strengthening local capacity. Begun as a pilot for 78 local governments, the project is being scaled up by the government nationwide. Appendix E gives details of the winning projects.

GPOBA’s Bangladesh Mini-grid Project was selected in May as one of six winners (out of 168 nominations) at the World Bank’s first Innovation Awards, administered by a team from the Innovation Labs. The Mini-grid Project tested a business model implemented for solar home systems on new renewable technologies. A $1.1 million grant financed 41 solar irrigation pumps benefiting 1,356 poor farmers, and a 100kW solar-powered mini-grid providing energy to 253 poor households. The mini-grid replaced polluting fuel sources such as diesel with clean energy, and income-generating activities developed in project areas. Farmers reported reduced irrigation costs and savings in time and labor. Lessons learned are being shared with Mali, Uganda, Tanzania, and other countries.

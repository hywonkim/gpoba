In FY2015, GPOBA focused on moving the pipeline of existing projects forward, while also testing the applicability of OBA in new sectors, and scaling up successful OBA pilots in sectors where it has considerable experiences. Technical assistance continued to make important contributions to business development, and eight new TA activities were initiated in FY15. Studies were launched or completed on the use of OBA/RBF in a range of sectors, and OBA approaches were tested and monitored throughout the year in fragile and conflict-affected situations. [where will we link to FCS Box?] Together, these newly initiated and ongoing activities build GPOBAâ€™s knowledge bank of best practices and lessons learned, re-enforcing the crucial flow between operations and knowledge.

In FY15, GPOBA signed five new grant agreements, totaling $49.9 million. This figure includes three scale-ups of GPOBA pilots in Kenya, Uganda, and Bangladesh, a project extending electricity access in Zambia, and an urban sanitation project in Ghana. Details of the projects are contained on the Grant Agreements page of this report.

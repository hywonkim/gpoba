One of GPOBA’s core objectives is to become a Center of Expertise (CoE) on the effective use of OBA and RBF for basic service delivery. GPOBA’s aim to ensure that knowledge and experience gained through the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of OBA subsidy projects and TA activities both feeds back into its own operations and is shared with development partners to support the adoption of OBA/RBF. 

GPOBA continued during the fiscal year to build towards this goal of becoming an information hub and resource through offering a range of advisory, knowledge, and learning services, and facilitating the sharing of best practices. Activities undertaken throughout the year – scoping the feasibility of OBA/RBF approaches in new sectors, deepening the impact of successful pilots through scale-up projects and OBA facilities, disseminating lessons from closed projects, and undertaking M&E initiatives to demonstrate proof of the OBA/RBF concept – all supported GPOBA’s objective of becoming a CoE. Additionally, OBA webinars, which bring together experts and thought leaders in OBA/RBF, and GPOBA’s Community of Practice, a platform that enables knowledge sharing and cross-sectoral collaboration, are deepening GPOBA’s knowledge base.

To strengthen its effectiveness going forward, GPOBA commissioned an independent evaluation of its activities. This report is nearing completion. Universalia delivered its draft evaluation report in April 2015 and GPOBA met with representatives from DFID, Sida, and DFAT at the end of June to discuss these findings. The final evaluation report is expected in early FY16. Its results will be carefully considered in further consultation with donors.

A key communications activity this fiscal year was the initiation of a re-branding exercise that will continue through FY17. The initial phase of this work used an in-depth landscape analysis to discern current perceptions of and context for GPOBA through stakeholder interviews, focus group workshops, and an online survey. Results of the research and analysis will inform GPOBAâ€™s positioning and communications strategy, brand guidelines, and tone and writing style guide.
 
In FY16, the GPOBA website continued to drive communications for feature stories and knowledge products, while the bi-monthly OBA Connections newsletter (http://www.gpoba.org/newsletter) presented practitioners with news and research related to innovative development financing and key events throughout the year. GPOBA also introduced a targeted monthly newsletter for donors and initiated monthly Community of Practice updates to highlight new content and encourage participation. All of these activities have both strengthened GPOBA as a CoE and helped the team to communicate more effectively with key development partners.

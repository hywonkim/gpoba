GPOBA worked strongly in FY16 to advance its active portfolio of subsidy projects and continued developing several projects in the pipeline to expand the use of OBA/RBF approaches. The new grant agreement signed supporting renewable energy access in the Philippines is the result of ongoing GPOBA work in that country, while the Kenya electrification scale-up builds on the success of an earlier OBA project that helped bring electricity to Nairobi’s informal settlements. GPOBA’s technical assistance activities provided insights and experience that support project design and implementation, as well as contribute to GPOBA’s growing knowledge base of best practices and lessons learned. Four studies explored new opportunities for OBA/RBF interventions in untested sectors, while the energy and water sector studies (discussed in the previous section) deepened the understanding of OBA’s impact in these tested sectors, helping to indicate where and how future interventions might best be undertaken.

GPOBA’s extensive range of TA activities has underpinned subsidy projects and knowledge work since GPOBA’s inception. In FY16, five new activities were initiated – in transport, social development, solid waste management, and energy – totaling $903,000. 

* **OBA Facility in the Bangladesh Garment Sector.** This TA supports the launch of the World Bank’s WEvolve program in South Asia, which is combating gender inequality and gender-based violence. It explores opportunities for OBA/RBF in the garment industry, including a possible OBA/RBF facility that would manage funding to subsidize services targeting women, such as job training, childcare, and safe transportation. 

* **Nepal: Strengthening Audit and Accreditation.** This TA supports Nepal’s National Vigilance Center, a government independent verification agent, to implement results-based approaches in the delivery of construction assets under the IDA’s Strengthening National Rural Transport Program. Improved results verification is critical in Nepal for increasing accountability. 

* **Philippines Access to Sustainable Energy (ASEP)-PV Mainstreaming.** Focusing on the development of high-level design details, such as documentation structure and bidding criteria, this activity supports the implementing partner in the PV Mainstreaming program. 

* **Thimphu City Bus Access.** Undertaken in tandem with GPOBA’s global urban transport scoping study, this TA is assessing the potential for OBA to improve access to quality public transport in Bhutan’s capital, Thimphu, also considering gender, safety, and socially inclusive access into account. 

* **Zambia: Improving Municipal Solid Waste Management.** A rapid study of the feasibility of OBA/RBF solutions in the solid waste sector in Zambia, this TA assesses the sector’s existing legal, institutional, policy, and financing frameworks. It uses the municipality of Kabwe as a case study for challenges faced across the country, with a view to developing an OBA/RBF project design which would include private sector participation.

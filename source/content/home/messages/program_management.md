Since its establishment in 2003, the Global Partnership on Output-Based Aid (GPOBA) has implemented a diverse range of subsidy projects that enable more than nine million poor people in 28 countries to access basic social services. This fiscal year marked GPOBA’s third highest level of subsidy disbursement in its history, evidence that we are working successfully with our many government and private-sector partners to make a tangible difference in people’s lives. 

The annual report for FY16 offers an in-depth look at GPOBA’s activities as it funds, designs, demonstrates, and documents output-based aid (OBA) approaches to basic service delivery for the poor. This year, we combined strong operational support to our active projects – many of which are implemented in challenging environments marked by political instability, conflict, and natural disaster – with new business development. Two new grant agreements were signed for energy projects in the Philippines and Kenya. GPOBA also strengthened its monitoring and evaluation capacity through the development of a results framework, which will allow for better planning and more consistent and closer tracking of our objectives. GPOBA ended this year having disbursed $16.7 million to subsidy projects, a 12.5 percent increase over the previous year.

Technical assistance and knowledge activities, the other two elements of GPOBA’s portfolio, together total 188 activities and $32.6 million, and this year included studies examining the potential for OBA and other forms of results-based financing (RBF) in untested sectors including urban transport and affordable housing, as well as the launch of the OBA/RBF Academy and GPOBA University, which significantly enrich our learning offerings. 

Now drawing on 13 years of experience, GPOBA continues to serve as a Center of Expertise on OBA and RBF, sharing best practices and lessons learned with our development partners. These knowledge-sharing and convening activities are key to building strategic partnerships, which underpin all of our work at GPOBA. Our location within the World Bank’s Social, Urban, Rural and Resilience Global Practice – which aims to create more sustainable, inclusive, and resilient communities – supports the development of partnerships that extend the potential for OBA and RBF interventions, while advancing the global conversation on results-based approaches. 

The achievements of this fiscal year were possible only through the continued support of our donors, whose commitment to OBA/RBF is the foundation of our work. We look forward to the coming year’s opportunities, as we partner with donors, governments, and other development partners to further explore OBA and other forms of RBF as innovative financing mechanisms in working towards the Sustainable Development Goals, helping to ensure poor and marginalized populations access the basic services for sustainable communities and economic development.

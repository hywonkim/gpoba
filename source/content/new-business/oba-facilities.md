title: Scale-ups and Development of OBA Facilities

GPOBA continues to actively engage with governments interested in mainstreaming OBA/RBF approaches within their own systems. All four of GPOBA’s scaled-up projects have been signed in the last 2 years, underscoring GPOBA’s commitment to applying the lessons and expertise gained through pilot projects to larger efforts, deepening the impact and reaching more beneficiaries. In FY15, as well as working with the governments of Bangladesh, Kenya, and Uganda on agreements scaling up pilot projects in the energy, water, and health sectors, GPOBA also worked with the governments of Nepal and the Philippines on potential OBA facilities in energy and water.

**Philippines OBA solar energy facility:** Between 2004 and 2014, GPOBA provided $725,000 in TA support to the Department of Energy’s (DoE) renewable energy strategy and policies, laying the groundwork for an OBA facility for renewable energy. In 2014, the DoE approved a regulatory framework aimed at providing renewable energy access to areas unserved by the grid, institutionalizing the ‘fee-for-service’ model for delivery of Solar Home Systems (SHS). GPOBA is proposing a $3 million grant for the facility, with co-financing from the European Union and the DoE. The OBA facility could provide about 205,000 beneficiaries with access to clean renewable energy through SHS.

**Philippines OBA water facility: Drawing on lessons from a GPOBA-funded water pilot in Manila, GPOBA provided $541,000 in TA from 2009-2014 to support the development of an OBA facility for water and sanitation. In 2015, a study co-financed by GPOBA, ‘Philippines Water Supply and Sanitation Unified Financing Framework’, was finalized. It reviews sector challenges and resources, as well as innovative financing strategies in other countries to propose a framework for increasing financing and water service coverage in the Philippines. The proposals, which include OBA subsidies to connect poor households, are being discussed with the GoP. 

**Nepal OBA energy facility**: Following the successful completion of the Nepal Biogas Project in 2012, GPOBA carried out TA activities related to mainstreaming OBA in the off-grid rural renewable energy sector in Nepal. The report resulting from these activities made recommendations as to how mainstreaming of renewable energy might advance and laid out a framework for a proposed OBA facility, particularly in the context of the government’s National Rural and Renewable Energy Program and its Central Renewable Energy Fund.

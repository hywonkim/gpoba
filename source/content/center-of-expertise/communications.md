GPOBA’s ongoing communications strategy aims to position OBA in the context of RBF and the results agendas of development partners, as well as in the broader international discussion on aid effectiveness and innovative finance. In FY15, the communications team built on its multi-faceted dissemination and outreach program, and focused on improving GPOBA’s visibility and profile within the World Bank Group and externally, highlighting GPOBA’s relevance during the World Bank’s organizational restructuring. In response to the new structure, the team realigned its communications efforts in order to reach target audiences, with particular focus on outreach to the newly created global practices (GPs) within the World Bank. Comprehensive briefings were delivered to GP senior management, and a web package was developed for the launch of GPOBA/World Bank publication of *Results-Based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste*. A presentation explaining GPOBA to its new global practice led to a new knowledge product – whyOBA? – on the World Bank’s knowledge-sharing platform. 

The communications team also promoted OBA in other key venues, including the annual Africa Energy Yearbook; a session on Reaching the Urban Poor at the GPSURR Forum; the World Bank’s Solutions Café, which looked at projects supporting sustainable energy access for the poor; and the second annual Inn-OBA-tions Awards, which recognized projects from FY15 that best exemplified successful and innovative implementation of OBA. GPOBA produced two videos this year – [an animated short](https://www.gpoba.org/video.developmentfinancingforresults) explaining the benefits of OBA/RBF compared to traditional development financing, and the [Honduras Water and Sanitation video](https://www.gpoba.org/video.honduras.water), which includes interviews with local residents benefitting from this OBA project.

GPOBA’s [web presence](http://www.gpoba.org/) grew during the year. Improvements to its website and newsletter resulted in an 11 percent increase in unique website visitors, while average newsletter readership increased by 40 percent. GPOBA also improved communication with donors by introducing bimonthly donor updates.

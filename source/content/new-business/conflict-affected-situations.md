Throughout the world, poverty is increasingly concentrated in countries and regions affected by fragility and conflict. There are now 33 countries and territories on the WBG list of Fragile Situations, and it is estimated that the share of global poor living in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) will at least double by 2030. Fragility and conflict can range from domestic or cross-border violence to vulnerability to extreme weather events related to climate change, such as flooding or droughts. Newly fragile areas may emerge with little warning, and countries or regions can experience successive shocks. Liberia, for example, was recovering from a fifteen-year civil war when it was hit by the Ebola crisis.

The provision of basic services has the potential to support stabilization and lessen the impact of fragility and conflict on people’s lives, and GPOBA has been committed to exploring the implementation of OBA/RBF approaches to service delivery in these difficult environments. It has built up a significant FCS subsidy portfolio, with active and closed projects now totaling almost $42 million and with an expected 2.4 million beneficiaries. GPOBA also has a portfolio of almost $4 million of technical assistance projects in FCS. Link to/pop up table of TA in FCS

Working in FCS brings with it a range of challenges, and this table [Pop-up table] highlights the issues faced in FY15 by GPOBA subsidy projects in FCS. While some projects face capacity-related obstacles, even those that have built capacity during implementation can be delayed or derailed by external factors such as heightened civil disturbance or a public health emergency. In FY15, GPOBA concentrated on understanding and addressing project preparation and implementation issues that arose in FCS projects. The team focused on early identification of capacity issues and additional monitoring and evaluation of existing projects. GPOBA also worked to generate and share knowledge drawn from project experience. As part of the WBG’s Fragility, Conflict and Violence Global Forum in February, GPOBA convened specialists in social development, urban services, information and communications technology,  transport, and OBA/RBF for a panel on Efficient Basic Services Delivery in FCS. Panelists shared practical experience from projects in Africa and Asia on how innovative financing tools such as OBA/RBF can best be used to expand access to basic services in FCS. 

Experience with OBA in FCS has shown that fragility factors are not necessarily the best indicators of a project’s eventual success. Quality of design and flexibility, along with targeted technical assistance throughout the project cycle have proved stronger predictors. Projects have been successfully implemented in situations where there was ongoing violence or unrest, while corruption, lack of rule of law, and institutional weakness have worked against project success. OBA is most likely to be effective in countries or regions showing signs of recovery, where government institutions are relatively stable and gradually increasing in legitimacy. When such an enabling environment exists, OBA and RBF mechanisms can contribute to broader efforts at breaking cycles of fragility and violence through providing basic services to the poor and increasing accountability among providers.

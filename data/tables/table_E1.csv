Collaboration Award,Kenya Electricity,Kenya,Energy,"In Kenya, a $5 million GPOBA grant leveraged $21 million from IDA, the electricity provider and user contributions to provide connections to poor households in Kenyaês informal settlements.  There were significant problems working around the cartels. To find solutions, the urban team pitched in with site selection/community involvement.  The water practice shared knowledge from their program in Kawole Soweto, and transport made sure the connections were included in their resettlement action plan. As a result, electricity connections went from 3,500 over a two-year period to 12,000 in the next 5 months."
Inclusion Award,Bolivia Decentralized Energy for Universal Access,Bolivia,Energy,"This project used OBA subsidies to support private providers in delivering SHS for rural households, microenterprises, schools, and clinics. Through careful targeting, the project helped improve the living conditions of 60,000 people, primarily indigenous. Furthermore, the project interacted strongly with local communities and organizations, developing a sense of ownership among the beneficiaries."
Pioneer Award,Zimbabwe Health Sector Development Support,Zimbabwe,Health,"In the FCS environment of Zimbabwe, this project was developed to remove financial barriers to health care access on the demand-side and strengthen service delivery with a focus on supply-side results. The project uses a combination of RBF mechanisms-- in rural areas, a pay-for- performance mechanism rewards primary and secondary care health facilities based on quantity and quality of services. In low-income urban areas, the RBF scheme combines demand-side urban maternal health vouchers and a pay-for-quality scheme. The success of the project has led to a national RBF scale-up plan."
Pioneer Award Special Mentions,Oaxaca Water Supply and Sanitation Sector Modernization,Mexico,WSS,"This project introduced an innovative RBF approach in the water sector, marking the first time PforR operations have been used to support WSS sector institutional reform and improvements in urban water services. The project also introduced the use of the PforR instrument for the first time in Mexico, where there was very little RBF experience and in a challenging subnational environment."
,RBF for Municipal Solid Waste study,"Nepal, West Bank, Malaysia, China, Indonesia, Tanzania, Mali, Jamaica",Solid Waste,"This project developed 5 customized RBF mechanisms (China, Jamaica, Indonesia, Malaysia, Tanzania), and synthesized design features and lessons from 3 more: Mali, Nepal, West Bank-- the latter of which are partially funded by GPOBA. The different schemes apply RBF to improve solid waste service delivery and fee collection, promote recycling and source separation, and strengthen waste collection and transport in underserved communities. Before initiation of this activity, the RBF mechanism had never before been applied in SWM; it has helped to establish a framework for future RBF work in SWM."
,Indonesia Clean Stove Initiative,Indonesia,Energy,"This project is the first to introduce and operationalize the RBF approach for clean cook stoves in Indonesia, to scale up access to clean and efficient cooking solutions through capacity building, policy development, and support for selected government action plans. Under this approach, the private sector finances the inputs (stoves) and public resources are used to reimburse the services provider upon delivery of results. This gives suppliers the flexibility to innovate, which is critical for market development. The pilot has attracted other development partners, including the ADB."

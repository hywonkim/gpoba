GPOBA also has an active portfolio of TA activities, with eight new grants awarded this year, bringing the total number of TA grants to date to XX. These activities support knowledge development and dissemination of OBA/RBF approaches, and grants to develop OBA pilots projects. TA support for RBF activities includes work with the World Bank’s Program for Results (PforR), which links disbursement of funds to the achievement of specific program results.

The International Development Association (IDA) is the World Bank’s fund for the poorest. Countries that lack the creditworthiness needed to borrow from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and those with per capita gross national income below $1,175 are eligible for IDA support. Countries that are IDA-eligible based on per capita income levels and are also creditworthy for some IBRD borrowings are referred to as ‘blend’ countries.

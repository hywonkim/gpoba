GPOBA’s knowledge and learning (K&L) program continues to expand through a range of online and face-to face-training activities, building awareness about the use of OBA/RBF approaches and supporting practitioners. Since its inception, the K&L program has helped GPOBA to reach a total of 3,913 people through 116 training and awareness-building activities. Participants have included development professionals from the World Bank Group, donors, government representatives, and local service providers. In FY15, GPOBA delivered 11 new training activities, reaching 603 people. The activities took place both internationally and within the World Bank, in partnership with WSP, ESMAP, and the World Bank Group’s Urban team. OBA trainings transitioned from the original two-day workshops to more targeted project concept clinics and other innovative session styles, in line with current knowledge management practices and approaches.

[quote]GPOBA held seven in-country workshops for the World Bank Group, development partners, government officials, and clients in field offices.[/quote] The focus of the workshops included building the technical capacity of independent verifiers in Indonesia; the application of OBA in the energy sector in Mali and Thailand; leveraging climate change related finance through RBF initiatives in Ethiopia; and training in Poland for governments on developing project concepts for OBA/RBF for increasing access to basic services for marginalized communities. In Kenya, a utilities reform workshop discussed challenges that water utility managers face in delivering sustainable water supply and sanitation services, and in Bangladesh, a workshop for the main actors in the garment industry explored how RBF/OBA can help address issues of gender-based violence and improved working conditions in the garment sector.

GPOBA took part in World Water Week in Stockholm, hosting a session highlighting OBA as an innovative financing solution for water and energy access. At the World Bank’s Water Week, GPOBA delivered two joint presentations with WSP. Trainings were also delivered on Reaching the Urban Poor during the World Bank Group’s GPSURR forum, with sessions in Washington and Istanbul.

The knowledge and learning program held four trainings in Washington, DC targeting World Bank Group team leaders and other development partners. These included two energy clinics for MCC staff on OBA for electricity access, as part of ongoing efforts to support MCC in mainstreaming results-based approaches in their operations. GPOBA held a water and sanitation clinic in April 2015 for World Bank Group teams to strengthen understanding of OBA’s core concepts and to assist practitioners in designing their own OBA projects. As a result of this clinic, GPOBA is currently pursuing three potential new projects in water and sanitation.

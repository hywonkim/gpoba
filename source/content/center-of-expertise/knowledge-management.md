GPOBA’s knowledge management activities support the close relationship between operations and knowledge. The team works to capture and facilitate knowledge flows, develop new knowledge tools, and disseminate knowledge products in order to reach interested practitioners and the wider development community.

Current publications draw on experience gained from GPOBA’s portfolio of projects, presenting information that informs future investments and operations. The OBApproaches series discusses OBA design and implementation, either through individual projects or through a thematic focus. In FY15, GPOBA produced five OBApproaches:

- [Mali Rural Electrification Hybrid Project](http://www.gpoba.org/OBA45_MaliEnergy);

- [Philippines Public Health Project](http://www.gpoba.org/Philippines.PublicHealth);

- [OBA and Solid Waste Management](http://www.gpoba.org/OBA46_SolidWaste);

- Scaling up Blended Financing of Water and Sanitation Investments in Kenya; and

- [OBA in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations](http://www.gpoba.org/OBA47_FCS).

The Lessons Learned series is based on findings following project completion. Five issues were produced in FY15:

- [Vietnam Rural Water](http://www.gpoba.org/LL07_VietnamWater);

- [Bangladesh Solar Homes Systems](http://www.gpoba.org/LL10_BangladeshEnergy);

- [Ethiopia Electricity](http://www.gpoba.org/LL09_EthiopiaElectricity);

- [Nepal Biogas](http://www.gpoba.org/LL08_NepalBiogas); and

- [Mumbai electricity](http://www.gpoba.org/LL06_MumbaiElectricity).

The Mumbai note, which explained the challenges faced in implementing the electricity project, won the GPSURR award for Best Documentation of Failure. GPOBA also contributed to the World Bank report, [Surge in Solar-Powered Homes: Experience in Off-grid Rural Bangladesh](http://www.gpoba.org/Solar.Home.Projects), which detailed on the positive effects SHSs have had on health outcomes, study hours, and security.

Other knowledge management work in FY15 included the Universe of RBF study, which developed a baseline of information on RBF actors, rends, and instruments. As well as expanding GPOBA’s knowledge of RBF, the study generated opportunities for GPOBA to collaborate with and learn from other RBF practitioners (see Box 5). GPOBA and the World Bank published a global study, [Results-Based Financing for Municipal Solid Waste](https://www.gpoba.org/MSW.Report). The study analyzed projects in eight countries that applied RBF approaches in the solid waste management sector, including two GPOBA- funded pilots in the West Bank and Nepal (Box 6<!-- jump to box? -->). The ‘Options Paper for Water Sector Regulation’ in the Philippines was also produced. This paper resulted from TA provided to the Government of the Philippines (GoP) in the water sector under
the Unified Financing Framework (Box 7<!-- jump to box? -->). It considered models of regulation in the sector and made recommendations to the GoP on which forms of regulation would be appropriate in the Philippine context and including OBA subsidies to connect poor households.

Ongoing knowledge work also includes activities related to GPOBA’s Community of Practice (CoP). Fostering the larger OBA/RBF community is an important component of GPOBA’s mission and vision, and the CoP provides a space for OBA/RBF practitioners to share best practices through peer learning, knowledge exchange, cross-sectoral collaboration, and networking. GPOBA expanded its CoP activities by moving to an [online space](https://collaboration.worldbank.org/groups/output-based-aid-cop-oba-cop) on the World Bank’s Collaboration for Development (C4D) platform in order to increase external participation among development practitioners, with the result that 44 percent of CoP members are now external to the World Bank.

Webinars are another important GPOBA knowledge activity. Webinars bring together experts, strategic partners, and thought leaders inOBA/RBF,fordialogueandknowledge-sharing. They enable the in-depth exchange of experience and ideas, and are living knowledge tools retained for continued reference. Four [webinars](http://www.gpoba.org/webinars) were held in FY15, focusing on the water, irrigation, energy, climate change, and solid waste sectors.

An initiative led by the World Bank Group, the Development Challenges/Solutions Approaches (DCSA), links knowledge and operations through the DCSA solutions platform, providing clients and decision-makers with interactive, timely project approaches and potential solutions. GPOBA contributed a DCSA, ‘How can countries incentivize public and private providers to extend basic services to the urban and rural poor?’ drawing on lessons from Uganda health, Morocco water and sanitation, and Kenya community water projects.

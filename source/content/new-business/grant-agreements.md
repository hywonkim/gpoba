Over the years, OBA projects have utilized a range of approaches, each one with a unique design and financial model, and incorporating lessons learned from previous experience. All new project proposals come before an independent Panel of Experts (PoE) at two stages of their preparation: 

**Eligibility**: An initial assessment to ensure that the project meets GPOBA’s eligibility criteria, which include the country and sector, project sustainability, and the number of poor people expected to receive services.

**Commitment**: A review of the project to determine whether it is ready for implementation and that, in its final form, it continues to meet the eligibility criteria. Since GPOBA is administered by the World Bank, projects going to commitment undergo fiduciary reviews with respect to financial management and procurement, along with assessments of environmental and social impacts, in accordance with World Bank policy

In Fy15, the PoE brought the Bangladesh clean energy scale-up project through the eligibility, commitment, and grant signing phases. The Solomon Islands energy project, which was approved for eligibility in FY14 and is expected to provide grid connections for over 5,000 peri-urban households, will be presented to the PoE for commitment in FY16.  

Five new grant agreements for OBA subsidy projects were signed in FY15 for Africa and South Asia, totaling $49.9 million. Together, these projects are expected to provide an estimated 1.76 million people with access to basic services in the energy, health, and water and sanitation sectors. They are detailed below.  

**Increasing electricity access in Zambia:** This project will bring access to grid-based electricity for 22,000 low-income households and 5,000 micro and small enterprises in urban and peri-urban areas of Zambia, benefitting 140,000 residents. The $4.95 million subsidy is funded by the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). It is GPOBA’s first project in Zambia, and builds on the ongoing Increased Access to Electricity Services (IAES) project, co-financed by the WBG and the European Commission.

**Sustainable sanitation facilities in Ghana:** This project will partially subsidize access to new and sustainable toilet facilities for 6,600 households in low-income areas of Greater Accra Metropolitan Area (GAMA), Ghana’s largest metropolitan region. Funded by a $4.85 million grant from the UK’s Department of International Development (DFID), the project is part of a larger IDA scheme to increase access to improved water and sanitation in the GAMA. 

**Scaling up access to water in Kenya:** This scale-up of a successful OBA pilot project for community-managed water will help water services providers access loan finance from the domestic private sector to fund water and sanitation subprojects in municipal and county-owned utilities. GPOBA subsidies, funded by an $11.84 million grant from Sida, will benefit 30,000 low-income households under this initiative. 

**Improving Maternal Health in Uganda:** This scale-up project builds on the successful reproductive health voucher pilot program launched in 2007, which assisted in the safe delivery of 65,590 babies and provided reproductive health care services to more than 136,000 women in rural Ugandan communities. The new five-year project, funded by a $13.3 million grant from Sida, will use vouchers to subsidize the cost of maternal and reproductive health care for poor women. It will be implemented by Uganda’s Ministry of Health, and is expected to contribute to over 132,000 safe deliveries. The project builds national capacity to mainstream the safe delivery voucher scheme in the health sector.

**Expanding access to clean energy in Bangladesh**: Building on a highly successful pilot program concluded in 2015, which saw the installation of Solar Home Systems (SHSs) benefitting over 2.2 million poor people in Bangladesh, this scale-up expands access to renewable energy to include mini-grids, solar irrigation pumps, and biogas plants. The project, supported by a $15 million grant from DFID, as well as the WBG, the Government of Bangladesh, and other development partners, will target poor households in remote areas. Project implementation will be gender-inclusive, with service providers targeting local women in marketing strategies and customer trainings, and consulting them during the installation process.
